    abstract = {The solar cell based on organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite is progressing amazingly fast in last decade owing to the robust experimental and theoretical investigations. First-principles calculation is one of the crucial ways to understand the nature of the materials and is practically helpful to the development and application of perovskite solar cells. Here, we briefly review the progress of theoretical studies we made in the last few years on the modification of electronic structures of perovskites by varying the composition, configuration, and structure, and the new understandings into the defect properties of halide perovskites for solar cell and optoelectronic applications. These understandings are foundations and new starting points for future investigations. We hope the experience and inspiration gained from these studies encourage more theoretical explorations for new functional perovskite-based materials.},

    abstract = {We present large-scale dynamical simulations of electronic phase separation in the single-band double-exchange model based on deep-learning neural-network potentials trained from small-size exact diagonalization solutions. We uncover an intriguing correlation-induced freezing behavior as doped holes are segregated from half-filled insulating background during equilibration. While the aggregation of holes is stabilized by the formation of ferromagnetic clusters through Hund's coupling between charge carriers and local magnetic moments, this stabilization also creates confining potentials for holes when antiferromagnetic spin-spin correlation is well developed in the background. The dramatically reduced mobility of the self-trapped holes prematurely disrupts further growth of the ferromagnetic clusters, leading to an arrested phase separation. Implications of our findings for phase separation dynamics in materials that exhibit colossal magnetoresistance effect are discussed.},
