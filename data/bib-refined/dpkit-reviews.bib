    abstract = {Since their introduction about 25 years ago, machine learning (ML) potentials have become an important tool in the field of atomistic simulations. After the initial decade, in which neural networks were successfully used to construct potentials for rather small molecular systems, the development of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) in 2007 opened the way for the application of ML potentials in simulations of large systems containing thousands of atoms. To date, many other types of ML potentials have been proposed continuously increasing the range of problems that can be studied. In this review, the methodology of the family of HDNNPs including new recent developments will be discussed using a classification scheme into four generations of potentials, which is also applicable to many other types of ML potentials. The first generation is formed by early neural network potentials designed for low-dimensional systems. High-dimensional neural network potentials established the second generation and are based on three key steps: first, the expression of the total energy as a sum of environment-dependent atomic energy contributions; second, the description of the atomic environments by atom-centered symmetry functions as descriptors fulfilling the requirements of rotational, translational, and permutation invariance; and third, the iterative construction of the reference electronic structure data sets by active learning. In third-generation HDNNPs, in addition, long-range interactions are included employing environment-dependent partial charges expressed by atomic neural networks. In fourth-generation HDNNPs, which are just emerging, in addition, nonlocal phenomena such as long-range charge transfer can be included. The applicability and remaining limitations of HDNNPs are discussed along with an outlook at possible future developments.},

    abstract = {The rapidly developing field of physics-informed learning integrates data and mathematical models seamlessly, enabling accurate inference of realistic and high-dimensional multiphysics problems. This Review discusses the methodology and provides diverse examples and an outlook for further developments. Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

The present contribution discusses applications ranging from small molecule reaction dynamics to computational platforms for reaction planning.

For one, Bayesian inference is a powerful approach to develop models consistent with knowledge from experiments. Second, ML-based methods can also be used to handle problems that are formally intractable using conventional approaches, such as exhaustive characterization of state-to-state information in reactive collisions. Finally, the explicit simulation of reactive networks as they occur in combustion has become possible using machine-learned neural network potentials. This review provides an overview of the questions that can and have been addressed using machine learning techniques, and an outlook discusses challenges in this diverse and stimulating field.

Yet, their membrane-bound form and their interfacial-binding site with membrane lipids remain difficult to observe directly. Their binding and unbinding mechanism, the conformational changes of the PMPs and their influence on the membrane structure are notoriously challenging to study experimentally. Molecular dynamics simulations are particularly useful to fill some knowledge-gaps and provide hypothesis that can be experimentally challenged to further our understanding of PMP-membrane recognition. Because of the time-scales of PMP-membrane binding events and the computational costs associated with molecular dynamics simulations, membrane models at different levels of resolution are used and often combined in multiscale simulation strategies. We here review membrane models belonging to three classes: atomistic, coarse-grained and implicit. Differences between models are rooted in the underlying theories and the reference data they are parameterized against. The choice of membrane model should therefore not only be guided by its computational efficiency. The range of applications of each model is discussed and illustrated using examples from the literature. [GRAPHICS] .},

Their utility derives from their unique ability to access multiple metal-charge states within a finite energy window. However, this property also confounds our ability to study reducible oxides, because it leads to structural, compositional and electronic complexities that elude simplistic models of materials structure and function. Oxygen vacancies play a critical role in shaping the functional properties of such oxides; most notably, they lead to mobile-charge imbalances that impact surface processes at substantial distances from the originating defect. Atomistic simulations are inherently equipped to illuminate these phenomena at a fundamental level; however, reducible oxides pose great challenges, owing to the high level of electron correlation needed to correctly describe them. Understanding how defects form, couple, propagate, agglomerate or repel each other and influence the surface properties of reducible oxides is only now coming into the grasp of modern theory and simulation capabilities. This knowledge is also key to discovering and controlling emergent materials properties with tunable multifunctionalities at the nanometre scale and beyond. Reducible oxides are tunable, multifunctional materials used in many applications, particularly in catalysis; their attractive properties arise from their interacting charge carriers, complex electronic structure and propensity to form mobile defects. This Review surveys theoretical methods to model and understand reducible oxides, using TiO2 as a prototypical example.},

    abstract = {In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for dealing with the difficulty of representing high dimensional functions. This gives us an unprecedented opportunity to revisit theoretical foundations of various scientific fields, develop new schemes, improve existing methodologies, and solve problems that were too complicated for conventional approaches to address. In this dissertation, we identify a list of such problems in the context of multiscale molecular modeling and propose machine learning based strategies to boost simulations with ab initio accuracy to much larger scales than conventional approaches. We consider two representative challenges: 1) how to go from many-electron-ion to atomistic systems, for which the key has been a general and efficient representation of the potential energy surface generated by electronic structure models; 2) how to go from atomistic to coarse-grained systems, for which one is interested in the free energy of the coarse-grained variables as well as the associated dynamical behavior. Our strategies follow two seemingly obvious but non-trivial principles: 1) machine learning based models should respect important physical constraints like symmetry; 2) to build truly reliable models, efficient algorithms are needed to construct a minimal but truly representative training data set. We use these principles to construct the Deep Potential model for the potential energy surface, the Deep Potential Molecular dynamics (DeePMD) which is a new paradigm for performing ab initio molecular dynamics, a concurrent learning scheme (DP-GEN) for generating the data set on the fly, algorithms for constructing the Wannier centers (Deep Wanner) and for efficiently exploring the free energy landscape (Reinforced Dynamics), as well as a machine learning-based coarse grained molecular dynamics model (DeePCG), etc.Applications of these models and algorithms are presented for problems in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Finally, we present our efforts on developing related open-source software packages, which have now been widely used worldwide by experts and practitioners in the molecular simulation community.},
