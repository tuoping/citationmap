@article{behlerFourGenerationsHighdimensional2021,
    abstract = {Since their introduction about 25 years ago, machine learning (ML) potentials have become an important tool in the field of atomistic simulations. After the initial decade, in which neural networks were successfully used to construct potentials for rather small molecular systems, the development of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) in 2007 opened the way for the application of ML potentials in simulations of large systems containing thousands of atoms. To date, many other types of ML potentials have been proposed continuously increasing the range of problems that can be studied. In this review, the methodology of the family of HDNNPs including new recent developments will be discussed using a classification scheme into four generations of potentials, which is also applicable to many other types of ML potentials. The first generation is formed by early neural network potentials designed for low-dimensional systems. High-dimensional neural network potentials established the second generation and are based on three key steps: first, the expression of the total energy as a sum of environment-dependent atomic energy contributions; second, the description of the atomic environments by atom-centered symmetry functions as descriptors fulfilling the requirements of rotational, translational, and permutation invariance; and third, the iterative construction of the reference electronic structure data sets by active learning. In third-generation HDNNPs, in addition, long-range interactions are included employing environment-dependent partial charges expressed by atomic neural networks. In fourth-generation HDNNPs, which are just emerging, in addition, nonlocal phenomena such as long-range charge transfer can be included. The applicability and remaining limitations of HDNNPs are discussed along with an outlook at possible future developments.},

@thesis{carboneDynamicalProcessesCondensed2021,
    abstract = {In this thesis, we study a broad range of physical phenomena from the perspectives of theorydriven, and machine learning models. We begin by introducing a generalization of the Momentum Average method for finding numerically exact Green’s functions of arbitrary polaron systems at zero and finite temperature. This method utilizes the physical ansatz that phonons are produced largely in clouds, and systematically constructs a closure of auxiliary Green’s functions to ultimately solve for the spectrum. We seamlessly apply this method to a variety of problems, including the Holstein, Peierls, and mixed-boson mode models. Next, we leverage fundamental quantum mechanics to develop a microscopic model of exciton and trion scattering in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. We conclude that elastic scattering mechanisms are largely the dominant contributor, and confirm that our calculated doping-dependent linewidths qualitatively agree with experiment. In addition, we use Monte Carlo dynamics to examine entropically activated dynamics in continuous phase space models, and show that global and local dynamics both exhibit entropy-driven activation. The second type of work discussed in this thesis pertains to data-driven machine learning models. These approaches offer the utility of instantaneous inference, which has tremendous potential application in applied science in areas such as surrogate modeling and creating digital twins of expensive experiments. First, we demonstrate that x-ray absorption spectra can be used to classify absorbing sites’ local atomic information, specifically its coordination number. Next, we show that graph-based neural networks can to quantitative accuracy, predict the x-ray absorption spectrum of small molecules in the QM9 database. We highlight the various ways in which these types of methodologies can be applied to e.g. closing the design loop and surrogate modeling in general.},

This Review discusses the methodology and provides diverse examples and an outlook for further developments. Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

    abstract = {Although electrostatics interactions in  uids have been studied for many decades, new results in this field are still challenging our classical understanding of electrolytes. The combination of electrostatics and self-assembly yields many interesting yet challenging problems that are of fundamental scienti
c interest and show promise for industrial applications. In this dissertation, I introduce our work on the topic of charged nanomaterials in aqueous salt solutions and how electrostatics play a role in different systems. The work summarized here is an attempt to develop methods to correctly model nanoscale charged systems in both low and high salt environments, and tackle the problem of simulating large systems with MD simulations by using coarse-graining techniques. First, we study nanoparticles immersed in concentrated monovalent salt ({$>$}0.5 mol/L1) using multi-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving atomic resolution and coarse-grained representations with implicit solvent. We attaind a surprising attractive to repulsive and then attractive re-entrant behavior as a function of salt concentration that cannot be predicted by previous theories and propose a rational explanation. Next, we explore the interaction of cylindrical interfaces in NaCl solutions to 
nd the screening length of charged cylinders and compare them with the prediction of the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. We also 
nd a depletion attraction between cylinders at high monovalent salt concentrations. We compare the results of MD simulations to mean-field theories as well as liquid state theory that incorporates ion correlations, and we show that the short-range ion correlations significantly impact the interactions between cylinders in concentrated monovalent salt solutions. Finally, we look into the complex biological system of bacterial microcompartment (MCP) assembly. Using all-atom (AA, explicit water, and ion) and coarse-grained (CG, implicit ion) MD simulations, combined with thermodynamics analysis, we find that electrostatic interactions (hydrogen bonds and charge distributions) play an important role in the self-assembly of native propanediol utilization (Pdu) MCPs. Combining AA and CG MD simulations, we predict various polyhedral and extended assembly shapes, and we predict what kinds of mutations lead to the success or failure of MCP assembly. The simulation and theoretical predictions match with the experimental observation of our collaborators and with published experiments.},

    abstract = {Machine learning (ML) techniques applied to chemical reactions have a long history. The present contribution discusses applications ranging from small molecule reaction dynamics to computational platforms for reaction planning. ML-based techniques can be particularly relevant for problems involving both computation and experiments. For one, Bayesian inference is a powerful approach to develop models consistent with knowledge from experiments. Second, ML-based methods can also be used to handle problems that are formally intractable using conventional approaches, such as exhaustive characterization of state-to-state information in reactive collisions. Finally, the explicit simulation of reactive networks as they occur in combustion has become possible using machine-learned neural network potentials. This review provides an overview of the questions that can and have been addressed using machine learning techniques, and an outlook discusses challenges in this diverse and stimulating field. It is concluded that ML applied to chemistry problems as practiced and conceived today has the potential to transform the way with which the field approaches problems involving chemical reactions, in both research and academic teaching.},

Yet, their membrane-bound form and their interfacial-binding site with membrane lipids remain difficult to observe directly. Their binding and unbinding mechanism, the conformational changes of the PMPs and their influence on the membrane structure are notoriously challenging to study experimentally. Molecular dynamics simulations are particularly useful to fill some knowledge-gaps and provide hypothesis that can be experimentally challenged to further our understanding of PMP-membrane recognition. Because of the time-scales of PMP-membrane binding events and the computational costs associated with molecular dynamics simulations, membrane models at different levels of resolution are used and often combined in multiscale simulation strategies. We here review membrane models belonging to three classes: atomistic, coarse-grained and implicit. Differences between models are rooted in the underlying theories and the reference data they are parameterized against. The choice of membrane model should therefore not only be guided by its computational efficiency. The range of applications of each model is discussed and illustrated using examples from the literature. [GRAPHICS] .},

The simplest approximation that can be applied in the context of the ACFDT is the random phase approximation (RPA). First, we show how the RPA can be improved by introducing a kernel containing an approximate electron-hole exchange term that leads to two different beyond-RPA methods. Then, we show that the RPA and beyond-RPA approaches can be efficiently computed within a plane-wave basis set implementation by using dielectric eigenpotentials as a compact auxiliary basis set and the Lanczos algorithm. A series of applications to molecules and solids are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these approximations. Importantly, it will be shown that the highly accurate beyond-RPA methods can be scaled to treat molecular systems with one hundred electrons requiring a basis set with hundreds of thousands of plane-waves. Finally, it is shown how the sophisticated and computationally expensive ACFDT methods can be used to compute finite-temperature properties of realistic materials (adsorption enthalpies of molecules in zeolites) by coupling molecular-dynamics simulations with machine learning algorithms.},

    abstract = {Redox-active oxides find use in many applications, including catalysts, photovoltaic devices, self-cleaning glasses, chemical sensors and electronic components. Their utility derives from their unique ability to access multiple metal-charge states within a finite energy window. However, this property also confounds our ability to study reducible oxides, because it leads to structural, compositional and electronic complexities that elude simplistic models of materials structure and function. Oxygen vacancies play a critical role in shaping the functional properties of such oxides; most notably, they lead to mobile-charge imbalances that impact surface processes at substantial distances from the originating defect. Atomistic simulations are inherently equipped to illuminate these phenomena at a fundamental level; however, reducible oxides pose great challenges, owing to the high level of electron correlation needed to correctly describe them. Understanding how defects form, couple, propagate, agglomerate or repel each other and influence the surface properties of reducible oxides is only now coming into the grasp of modern theory and simulation capabilities. This knowledge is also key to discovering and controlling emergent materials properties with tunable multifunctionalities at the nanometre scale and beyond. Reducible oxides are tunable, multifunctional materials used in many applications, particularly in catalysis; their attractive properties arise from their interacting charge carriers, complex electronic structure and propensity to form mobile defects. This Review surveys theoretical methods to model and understand reducible oxides, using TiO2 as a prototypical example.},

Here we present the path for the construction of machine learned molecular force fields by discussing the hierarchical pathway from generating the dataset of reference calculations to the construction of the machine learning model, and the validation of the physics generated by the model. We will use the the symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) framework due to its ability to reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces (PES) with high precision even when using just a few hundreds of molecular conformations for training. The data efficiency of the sGDML model allows using reference atomic forces computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the gold standard coupled cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)). We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML framework captures local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g. H-bonding, lone pairs, steric repulsion, changes in hybridization states (e.g. sp2 sp3), interactions, and proton transfer) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML models trained for different molecular structures at different levels of theory (e.g. density functional theory and CCSD(T)) provides empirical evidence that a higher level of theory generates a smoother PES. Additionally, a careful analysis of molecular dynamics simulations yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy.},

One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them.

    abstract = {Dynamics of flexible molecules are often determined by an interplay between local chemical bond fluctuations and conformational changes driven by long-range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. This interplay between interactions yields complex potential-energy surfaces (PESs) with multiple minima and transition paths between them. In this work, we assess the performance of the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models, namely, sGDML, SchNet, Gaussian Approximation Potentials/Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (GAPs/SOAPs), and Behler-Parrinello neural networks, for reproducing such PESs, while using limited amounts of reference data. As a benchmark, we use the cis to trans thermal relaxation in an azobenzene molecule, where at least three different transition mechanisms should be considered. Although GAP/SOAP, SchNet, and sGDML models can globally achieve a chemical accuracy of 1 kcal mol(-1) with fewer than 1000 training points, predictions greatly depend on the ML method used and on the local region of the PES being sampled. Within a given ML method, large differences can be found between predictions of close-to-equilibrium and transition regions, as well as for different transition mechanisms. We identify key challenges that the ML models face mainly due to the intrinsic limitations of commonly used atom-based descriptors. All in all, our results suggest switching from learning the entire PES within a single model to using multiple local models with optimized descriptors, training sets, and architectures for different parts of the complex PES.},

For example, understanding water and solute adsorption as well as catalytic water splitting can help build better fuel cells and solar cells to overcome our looming energy crisis; the interaction between biomolecules and water/oxide interfaces is one hypothesis to explain the origin of life. However, knowledge in this area is still limited due to the difficulty of studying water/solid interfaces. As a result, research using increasingly sophisticated experimental techniques and computational simulations has been carried out in recent years. Although it is difficult for experimental techniques to provide detailed microscopic structural information, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have satisfactory performance. In this review, we discuss classical and ab initio MD simulations of water/oxide interfaces. Generally, we are interested in the following questions: How do solid surfaces perturb interfacial water structure? How do interfacial water molecules and adsorbed solutes affect solid surfaces and how do interfacial environments affect solvent and solute behavior? Finally, we discuss progress in the application of neural network potential based MD simulations, which offer a promising future because this approach has already enabled ab initio level accuracy for very large systems and long trajectories.

This article focuses on one particular issue of broad interest: How can we integrate machine learning with physics-based modeling to develop new interpretable and truly reliable physical models? After introducing the general guidelines, we discuss the two most important issues for developing machine learning-based physical models: Imposing physical constraints and obtaining optimal datasets. We also provide a simple and intuitive explanation for the fundamental reasons behind the success of modern machine learning, as well as an introduction to the concurrent machine learning framework needed for integrating machine learning with physics-based modeling. Molecular dynamics and moment closure of kinetic equations are used as examples to illustrate the main issues discussed. We end with a general discussion on where this integration will lead us to, and where the new frontier will be after machine learning is successfully integrated into scientific modeling.},

    abstract = {Neural network-based machine learning is capable of approximating functions in very high dimension with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. This has opened up many exciting new possibilities, not just in traditional areas of artificial intelligence, but also in scientific computing and computational science. At the same time, machine learning has also acquired the reputation of being a set of "black box" type of tricks, without fundamental principles. This has been a real obstacle for making further progress in machine learning. In this article, we try to address the following two very important questions: (1) How machine learning has already impacted and will further impact computational mathematics, scientific computing and computational science? (2) How computational mathematics, particularly numerical analysis, can impact machine learning? We describe some of the most important progress that has been made on these issues. Our hope is to put things into a perspective that will help to integrate machine learning with computational mathematics.},

Their theoretical description requires highly accurate quantum chemical calculations, which are computationally expensive. In this review, we focus on not only how machine learning is employed to speed up such excited-state simulations but also how this branch of artificial intelligence can be used to advance this exciting research field in all its aspects. Discussed applications of machine learning for excited states include excited-state dynamics simulations, static calculations of absorption spectra, as well as many others. In order to put these studies into context, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques. Since the latter are mostly based on quantum chemistry calculations, we also provide a short introduction into excited-state electronic structure methods and approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and describe tricks and problems when using them in machine learning for excited states of molecules.},

In this thesis, I develop a class of deep learning methods that solve various types of learning problems for solid materials, and demonstrate its application to both accelerate material design and understand scientific knowledge. First, I present a neural network architecture to learn the representations of an arbitrary solid material, which encodes several fundamental symmetries for solid materials as inductive biases. Then, I extend the approach to explore four different learning problems: 1) supervised learning to predict material properties from structures; 2) visualization to understand structure-property relations; 3) unsupervised learning to understand atomic scale dynamics from time series trajectories; 4) active learning to explore an unknown material space. In each learning problem, I demonstrate the performance of the approach compared with previous approaches, and apply it to solve several realistic materials design problems and extract scientific insights from data.},

@article{xuPerspectiveComputationalReaction2021,
    abstract = {Heterogeneous catalysis plays a significant role in the modern chemical industry. Towards the rational design of novel catalysts, understanding reactions over surfaces is the most essential aspect. Typical industrial catalytic processes such as syngas conversion and methane utilisation can generate a large reaction network comprising thousands of intermediates and reaction pairs. This complexity not only arises from the permutation of transformations between species but also from the extra reaction channels offered by distinct surface sites. Despite the success in investigating surface reactions at the atomic scale, the huge computational expense of ab initio methods hinders the exploration of such complicated reaction networks. With the proliferation of catalysis studies, machine learning as an emerging tool can take advantage of the accumulated reaction data to emulate the output of ab initio methods towards swift reaction prediction. Here, we briefly summarise the conventional workflow of reaction prediction, including reaction network generation, ab initio thermodynamics and microkinetic modelling. An overview of the frequently used regression models in machine learning is presented. As a promising alternative to full ab initio calculations, machine learning interatomic potentials are highlighted. Furthermore, we survey applications assisted by these methods for accelerating reaction prediction, exploring reaction networks, and computational catalyst design. Finally, we envisage future directions in computationally investigating reactions and implementing machine learning algorithms in heterogeneous catalysis.},

However, modeling electrochemical systems is still a challenge, especially in interface electrochemistry, because not only solvation effects and ion distribution in electrolyte solutions should be considered, but also the treatment of the electrode potential and the response of electrolytes to applied potentials. Here, we review the latest development in the field of computational electrochemistry. We first introduce various energy models used in simulating electrolytes and electrodes at multiple scales. Then, to better explain and compare between different methods, we discuss the calculation methods of solution electrochemistry and interface electrochemistry in separate. At last, we introduce the methods to electrify the interfaces in various multiscale models. This review aims to help understand various levels of methods in simulations of different scenarios in electrochemistry, and summarizes a set of schemes covering multiple scales.

@article{Zhang2020c,
    abstract = {In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for dealing with the difficulty of representing high dimensional functions. This gives us an unprecedented opportunity to revisit theoretical foundations of various scientific fields, develop new schemes, improve existing methodologies, and solve problems that were too complicated for conventional approaches to address. In this dissertation, we identify a list of such problems in the context of multiscale molecular modeling and propose machine learning based strategies to boost simulations with ab initio accuracy to much larger scales than conventional approaches. We consider two representative challenges: 1) how to go from many-electron-ion to atomistic systems, for which the key has been a general and efficient representation of the potential energy surface generated by electronic structure models; 2) how to go from atomistic to coarse-grained systems, for which one is interested in the free energy of the coarse-grained variables as well as the associated dynamical behavior. Our strategies follow two seemingly obvious but non-trivial principles: 1) machine learning based models should respect important physical constraints like symmetry; 2) to build truly reliable models, efficient algorithms are needed to construct a minimal but truly representative training data set. We use these principles to construct the Deep Potential model for the potential energy surface, the Deep Potential Molecular dynamics (DeePMD) which is a new paradigm for performing ab initio molecular dynamics, a concurrent learning scheme (DP-GEN) for generating the data set on the fly, algorithms for constructing the Wannier centers (Deep Wanner) and for efficiently exploring the free energy landscape (Reinforced Dynamics), as well as a machine learning-based coarse grained molecular dynamics model (DeePCG), etc.Applications of these models and algorithms are presented for problems in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Finally, we present our efforts on developing related open-source software packages, which have now been widely used worldwide by experts and practitioners in the molecular simulation community.},

    abstract = {Chemical clusters are relevant to many applications in catalysis, separations, materials, and energy sciences. Experimentally, the structure of clusters is difficult to determine, but it is very important in understanding their chemistry and properties. Computational methods can be used to examine cluster structure, however finding the most stable structure is not simple, particularly as the cluster size increases. Global optimization techniques have long been used to tackle the problem of the most stable structure, but such approaches would have to look for a global minimum, while sampling local minima over the whole potential energy surface as well. In this review, the state-of-the-art theory of global optimization theory is summarized. First, the definition, significance, relation to experiments, and a brief history of global optimization is presented. We then discuss, in more detail, three versatile global optimization methods: the basin hopping, the artificial bee colony algorithm, and the genetic algorithm. We close with some representative application examples of global optimization of clusters since 2016 and the challenges, open questions and opportunities in this field.},
