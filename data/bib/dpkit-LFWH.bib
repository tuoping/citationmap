  abstract = {We have developed an accurate and efficient deep-learning potential (DP) for graphane, which is a fully hydrogenated version of graphene, using a very small training set consisting of 1000 snapshots from a 0.5 ps density functional theory (DFT) molecular dynamics simulation at 1000 K. We have assessed the ability of the DP to extrapolate to system sizes, temperatures, and lattice strains not included in the training set. The DP performs surprisingly well, outperforming an empirical many-body potential when compared with DFT data for the phonon density of states, thermodynamic properties, velocity autocorrelation function, and stress-strain curve up to the yield point. This indicates that our DP can reliably extrapolate beyond the limit of the training data. We have computed the thermal fluctuations as a function of system size for graphane. We found that graphane has larger thermal fluctuations compared with graphene, but having about the same out-of-plane stiffness.},

  abstract = {TiO2 is a widely used photocatalyst in science and technology and its interface with water is important in fields ranging from geochemistry to biomedicine. Yet, it is still unclear whether water adsorbs in molecular or dissociated form on TiO2 even for the case of well-defined crystalline surfaces. To address this issue, we simulated the TiO2-water interface using molecular dynamics with an ab initio-based deep neural network potential. Our simulations show a dynamical equilibrium of molecular and dissociative adsorption of water on TiO2. Water dissociates through a solvent-assisted concerted proton transfer to form a pair of short-lived hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface. Molecular adsorption of water is Delta F = 8.0 +/- 0.9 kJ mol(-1) lower in free energy than the dissociative adsorption, giving rise to a 5.6 +/- 0.5\% equilibrium water dissociation fraction at room temperature. Due to the relevance of surface hydroxyl groups to the surface chemistry of TiO2, our model might be key to understanding phenomena ranging from surface functionalization to photocatalytic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {A detailed understanding of the material response to rapid compression is challenging and demanding. For instance, the element gold under dynamic compression exhibits complex phase transformations where there exist some large discrepancies between experimental and theoretical studies. Here, we combined large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a deep potential to elucidate the dynamic compression processes of gold from an atomic level. The potential is constructed by accurately reproducing the free energy surfaces of density-functional-theory calculations for gold, from ambient conditions to 15 500 K and 500 GPa. Within this framework, we extend the simulations up to 200 000 atoms size, and found a much lower pressure threshold for phase transitioning from face-centered cubic (FCC) to body-centered (BCC), as compared to previous calculations. Furthermore, the transition pressure is strongly dependent on the shock direction, namely 159 GPa for ¡100¿ orientation and 219 GPa for ¡110¿ orientation, respectively. Most importantly, the accurate atomistic perspective presents that the shocked BCC structure contains unique features of medium-range and short-range orders, which is named "disorders" here. We propose a model and demonstrate that the existence of "disorders" significantly reduces the Gibbs free energies of shocked structures, therefore leading to the lowering of the phase transition pressure. The present study provides a new path to understand the structure dynamics under extreme conditions. The understanding of atomic structures under extreme conditions is of great importance in industrial applications and scientific studies, covering multidisciplinary fields of physics [1-3], chemistry [4, 5], materials [6], geophysics and astrophysics [7, 8]. Shock compression, served as a typical method to generate ultrahigh pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions [9, 10], leads to discoveries of unique thermodynamic states [11-13], unusual physical properties [14, 15], and unexpected meta-stable structures [7, 16-18]. With the development of in-situ time-resolved x-ray diffraction (XRD) methods, more attentions are paid to the phase transition process of shocked matters [17-21] rather than measuring the equation of state (EOS). Innumerous new phenomena have been observed and many experimental results present significantly different characteristics of structural transformation path between the dynamic and static compression, but the mechanism is far away to be known. There is a growing demand for theories from the atomic scale to understand the intrinsic mechanisms. Gold (Au) is a typical close-packed face-centered-cubic (FCC) structure at ambient conditions, and it can maintain FCC structure under static pressure up to several hundreds of GPa [13, 22]. Thus, many high-pressure experiments based on diamond-anvil-cell (DAC) prefer utilizing Au as calibration material [23]. Under isothermal compression at room temperature, FCC gold undergoes the transitions to hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure at 151 to 410 GPa in theoretical calculations [24-27], and at ∼248 GPa in experiments [22]. Ab initio calculations predict that FCC to body-centered-cubic (BCC) transition would not occur until 230 GPa. For samples under dynamic compression, heating is inseparable to the compression, and the locus of possible shock states is a curve in the pressure-density-temperature space called the Hugoniot curve. In the phase diagram of Au calculated by Ref. [25], the Hugoniot curve directly crosses the melting curve instead of the FCC-BCC boundary. It means the gold only undergoes melting transition and no FCC-BCC transition would be observed under dynamic compression. Extraordinarily, due to the recent construction of high-quality in situ XRD tool, two phase transition points from FCC to BCC have been observed at 223 GPa [17] or 150∼176 GPa [18] under two different shock-compression experiments. The FCC-BCC phase boundary is deemed to exist under much higher P-T conditions [25] in theoretical calculations, largely deviating from these experimental results. This controversy indicates that the dynamic process is significantly different between the static and shock compression, causing huge disparity of phase transition pressures. Although ab initio method can precisely predict the thermodynamic properties of shocked-compressed Au, it fails to capture the dynamic response process of the atoms and the evolution of microstructures under shock compression due to the limit of simulation sizes. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on semiclassical interatomic potentials is difficult to describe the interatomic interactions with so wide temperature and density range. It is urgently needed to obtain the detailed response of matters under rapid compression and reveal the intrinsic mechanisms in an accurate and large-scale way. In this work, we performed MD simulations to},

In this study, we present the deep-learning many-body potential (the deep potential) method to reduce the computational cost of simulations for the viscosity of liquid aluminum at high temperature and high pressure with accurate results. Viscosities for densities of 2.35 g/cm(3), 2.7 g/cm(3), 3.5 g/cm(3), and 4.27 g/cm(3) and temperatures from melting points to about 50000 K are calculated. The results agree well with the experiment data at a pressure near 1 bar and are consistent with the simulation of first-principles at high pressure and high temperature. We reveal the behavior of the shear viscosity of liquid Al at a range where the current experimental results do not exist. Based on the available experimental data and newly generated simulation data, we propose a modified Enskog-Dymond theory, which can analytically calculate the viscosity of Al at this range.

  abstract = {The possible existence of a metastable liquid-liquid transition (LLT) and a corresponding liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in supercooled liquid water remains a topic of much debate. An LLT has been rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal-multibaric ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an estimate of the LLCP's location. These combined results-obtained from a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters-are strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.},

Hydrodynamic approximation to the kinetic equation is used as an example to illustrate the main steps and issues involved. To this end, a set of generalized moments are constructed first to optimally represent the underlying velocity distribution. The well-known closure problem is then solved with the aim of best capturing the associated dynamics of the kinetic equation. The issue of physical constraints such as Galilean invariance is addressed and an active-learning procedure is introduced to help ensure that the dataset used is representative enough. The reduced system takes the form of a conventional moment system and works regardless of the numerical discretization used. Numerical results are presented for the BGK (Bhatnagar-GrossKrook) model and binary collision of Maxwell molecules.

  abstract = {Solid-state electrolyte materials with superior lithium ionic conductivities are vital to the next-generation Li-ion batteries. Molecular dynamics could provide atomic scale information to understand the diffusion process of Li-ion in these superionic conductor materials. Here, we implement the deep potential generator to set up an efficient protocol to automatically generate interatomic potentials for Li10GeP2S12-type solid-state electrolyte materials (Li10GeP2S12, Li10SiP2S12, and Li10SnP2S12). The reliability and accuracy of the fast interatomic potentials are validated. With the potentials, we extend the simulation of the diffusion process to a wide temperature range (300 K-1000 K) and systems with large size (similar to 1000 atoms). Important technical aspects such as the statistical error and size effect are carefully investigated, and benchmark tests including the effect of density functional, thermal expansion, and configurational disorder are performed. The computed data that consider these factors agree well with the experimental results, and we find that the three structures show different behaviors with respect to configurational disorder. Our work paves the way for further research on computation screening of solid-state electrolyte materials.},

This has been particularly challenging for multi-component alloy systems due to the complex and non-linear nature of the associated PES. In this work, we develop an accurate PES model for the Al-Cu-Mg system by employing Deep Potential (DP), a neural network based representation of the PES, and DP Generator (DP-GEN), a concurrent-learning scheme that generates a compact set of ab initio data for training. The resulting DP model gives predictions consistent with first-principles calculations for various binary and ternary systems on their fundamental energetic and mechanical properties, including formation energy, equilibrium volume, equation of state, interstitial energy, vacancy and surface formation energy, as well as elastic moduli. Extensive benchmark shows that the DP model is ready and will be useful for atomistic modeling of the Al-Cu-Mg system within the full range of concentration.},

Due to the presence of light atoms (e.g. or ), nuclear quantum fluctuations lead to observable changes in the structural properties of liquid water (e.g. isotope effects), and therefore provide yet another challenge for ab initio approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that the combination of dispersion-inclusive hybrid density functional theory (DFT), the Feynman discretised path-integral (PI) approach, and machine learning (ML) constitutes a versatile ab initio based framework that enables extensive sampling of both thermal and nuclear quantum fluctuations on a quite accurate underlying PES. In particular, we employ the recently developed deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) model ? a neural-network representation of the ab initio PES ? in conjunction with a PI approach based on the generalised Langevin equation (PIGLET) to investigate how isotope effects influence the structural properties of ambient liquid and . Through a detailed analysis of the interference differential cross sections as well as several radial and angular distribution functions, we demonstrate that this approach can furnish a semi-quantitative prediction of these subtle isotope effects.

Intriguingly, it has a natural correspondence to normalizing flows with a symplectic constraint. Building on this key insight, we design a neural canonical transformation approach to automatically identify independent slow collective variables in general physical systems and natural datasets. We present an efficient implementation of symplectic neural coordinate transformations and two ways to train the model based either on the Hamiltonian function or phase-space samples. The learned model maps physical variables onto an independent representation where collective modes with different frequencies are separated, which can be useful for various downstream tasks such as compression, prediction, control, and sampling. We demonstrate the ability of this method first by analyzing toy problems and then by applying it to real-world problems, such as identifying and interpolating slow collective modes of the alanine dipeptide molecule and MNIST database images.},

The effective force and effective mass matrix are important elements in the equations of motion of equilibrium continuity dynamics, where only the zeroth term of an exact series expansion of the phase space propagator is involved. We introduce a machine learning approach for fitting these elements in quantum phase space, leading to a much more efficient integration of the equations of motion.

In combination with a neural network representation of the interatomic potential energy surface, the scheme allows us to calculate the Raman spectra along 2-nanosecond classical trajectories at different temperatures for H2O and D2O. The vast gains in efficiency provided by the machine learning approach enable longer trajectories and larger system sizes relative to ab initio methods, reducing the statistical error and improving the resolution of the low-frequency Raman spectra.

On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information contained in the original model.

  abstract = {Machine learning is poised as a very powerful tool that can drastically improve our ability to carry out scientific research. However, many issues need to be addressed before this becomes a reality. This article focuses on one particular issue of broad interest: How can we integrate machine learning with physics-based modeling to develop new interpretable and truly reliable physical models? After introducing the general guidelines, we discuss the two most important issues for developing machine learning-based physical models: Imposing physical constraints and obtaining optimal datasets. We also provide a simple and intuitive explanation for the fundamental reasons behind the success of modern machine learning, as well as an introduction to the concurrent machine learning framework needed for integrating machine learning with physics-based modeling. Molecular dynamics and moment closure of kinetic equations are used as examples to illustrate the main issues discussed. We end with a general discussion on where this integration will lead us to, and where the new frontier will be after machine learning is successfully integrated into scientific modeling.},

  abstract = {The discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films opens up new opportunities for using this silicon-compatible ferroelectric to realize low-power logic circuits and high-density nonvolatile memories. The functional performances of ferroelectrics are intimately related to their dynamic responses to external stimuli such as electric fields at finite temperatures. Molecular dynamics is an ideal technique for investigating dynamical processes on large length and time scales, though its applications to new materials are often hindered by the limited availability and accuracy of classical force fields. Here we present a deep neural network-based interatomic force field of HfO2 learned from ab initio data using a concurrent learning procedure. The model potential is able to predict structural properties such as elastic constants, equation of states, phonon dispersion relationships, and phase transition barriers of various hafnia polymorphs with accuracy comparable with density functional theory calculations. The validity of this model potential is further confirmed by the reproduction of experimental sequences of temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions of HfO2 with isobaric-isothermal ensemble molecular dynamics simulations. We suggest a general approach to extend the model potential of HfO(2 )to related material systems including dopants and defects.},

The variational density matrix is parametrized by a permutation equivariant many-body unitary transformation together with a discrete probabilistic model. The unitary transformation is implemented as a quantum counterpart of neural canonical transformation, which incorporates correlation effects via a flow of fermion coordinates. As the first application, we study electrons in a two-dimensional quantum dot with an interaction-induced crossover from Fermi liquid to Wigner molecule. The present approach provides accurate results in the low-temperature regime, where conventional quantum Monte Carlo methods face severe difficulties due to the fermion sign problem. The approach is general and flexible for further extensions, thus holds the promise to deliver new physical results on strongly correlated fermions in the context of ultracold quantum gases, condensed matter, and warm dense matter physics.},

In particular, the deep neural network is trained based on ab initio data obtained from the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional. Because of the lighter mass of hydrogen than deuteron, the properties of light water are more influenced by nuclear quantum effect than those of heavy water. Clear isotope effects are observed and analyzed in terms of hydrogen-bond structure and electronic properties of water that are closely associated with experimental observables. The molecular structures of both liquid H2O and D2O agree well with the data extracted from scattering experiments. The delicate isotope effects on radial distribution functions and angular distribution functions are well reproduced as well. Our approach demonstrates that deep neural network combined with SCAN functional based ab initio molecular dynamics provides an accurate theoretical tool for modeling water and its isotope effects.},

Such models have become increasingly popular in molecular simulations given their ability to learn highly complex and multi-dimensional interactions within a local environment; however, many of them fundamentally lack a description of explicit long-range interactions. In order to provide a well-defined benchmark system with precisely known pairwise interactions, we chose as the reference model a flexible version of the Extended Simple Point Charge (SPC/E) water model. Our analysis shows that while local representations are sufficient for predictions of the condensed liquid phase, the short-range nature of machine-learning models falls short in representing cluster and vapor phase properties. These findings provide an improved understanding of the role of long-range interactions in machine learning models and the regimes where they are necessary.},

  abstract = {Combustion is a complex chemical system which involves thousands of chemical reactions and generates hundreds of molecular species and radicals during the process. In this work, a neural network-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized. Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory experiments could accomplish. Gaining insights into combustion processes is challenging due to the complex reactions involved. The present work proposes a neural network potential model trained to ab initio data that enables to simulate the combustion of methane by predicting reactants, products and reaction intermediates.},

  abstract = {The recently developed Deep Potential [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 143001, 2018] is a powerful method to represent general inter-atomic potentials using deep neural networks. The success of Deep Potential rests on the proper treatment of locality and symmetry properties of each component of the network. In this paper, we leverage its network structure to effectively represent the mapping from the atomic configuration to the electron density in Kohn-Sham density function theory (KS-DFT). By directly targeting at the self-consistent electron density, we demonstrate that the adapted network architecture, called the Deep Density, can effectively represent the electron density as the linear combination of contributions from many local clusters. The network is constructed to satisfy the translation, rotation, and permutation symmetries, and is designed to be transferable to different system sizes. We demonstrate that using a relatively small number of training snapshots, Deep Density achieves excellent performance for one-dimensional insulating and metallic systems, as well as systems with mixed insulating and metallic characters. We also demonstrate its performance for real three-dimensional systems, including small organic molecules, as well as extended systems such as water (up to 512 molecules) and aluminum (up to 256 atoms).},

  abstract = {In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for dealing with the difficulty of representing high dimensional functions. This gives us an unprecedented opportunity to revisit theoretical foundations of various scientific fields, develop new schemes, improve existing methodologies, and solve problems that were too complicated for conventional approaches to address. In this dissertation, we identify a list of such problems in the context of multiscale molecular modeling and propose machine learning based strategies to boost simulations with ab initio accuracy to much larger scales than conventional approaches. We consider two representative challenges: 1) how to go from many-electron-ion to atomistic systems, for which the key has been a general and efficient representation of the potential energy surface generated by electronic structure models; 2) how to go from atomistic to coarse-grained systems, for which one is interested in the free energy of the coarse-grained variables as well as the associated dynamical behavior. Our strategies follow two seemingly obvious but non-trivial principles: 1) machine learning based models should respect important physical constraints like symmetry; 2) to build truly reliable models, efficient algorithms are needed to construct a minimal but truly representative training data set. We use these principles to construct the Deep Potential model for the potential energy surface, the Deep Potential Molecular dynamics (DeePMD) which is a new paradigm for performing ab initio molecular dynamics, a concurrent learning scheme (DP-GEN) for generating the data set on the fly, algorithms for constructing the Wannier centers (Deep Wanner) and for efficiently exploring the free energy landscape (Reinforced Dynamics), as well as a machine learning-based coarse grained molecular dynamics model (DeePCG), etc.Applications of these models and algorithms are presented for problems in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Finally, we present our efforts on developing related open-source software packages, which have now been widely used worldwide by experts and practitioners in the molecular simulation community.},

The AMM simulated system is decomposed into three types of regions. The first type captures the important phenomena in the system and requires high accuracy, for which we use the Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DeePMD) model in this work. The DeePMD model is trained to accurately reproduce the statistical properties of the ab initio molecular dynamics. The second type does not require high accuracy, and a classical force field is used to describe it in an efficient way. The third type is used for a smooth transition between the first and the second types of regions. By using a force interpolation scheme and imposing a thermodynamics force in the transition region, we make the DeePMD region embedded in the AMM simulated system as if it were embedded in a system that is fully described by the accurate potential. A representative example of the liquid water system is used to show the feasibility and promise of this method.},

  abstract = {We introduce a general framework for constructing coarse-grained potential models without ad hoc approximations such as limiting the potential to two- and/or three-body contributions. The scheme, called the Deep Coarse-Grained Potential (abbreviated DeePCG), exploits a carefully crafted neural network to construct a many-body coarse-grained potential. The network is trained with full atomistic data in a way that preserves the natural symmetries of the system. The resulting model is very accurate and can be used to sample the configurations of the coarse-grained variables in a much faster way than with the original atomistic model. As an application, we consider liquid water and use the oxygen coordinates as the coarse-grained variables, starting from a full atomistic simulation of this system at the ab initio molecular dynamics level. We find that the two-body, three-body, and higher-order oxygen correlation functions produced by the coarse-grained and full atomistic models agree very well with each other, illustrating the effectiveness of the DeePCG model on a rather challenging task.},

  abstract = {In recent years, promising deep learning based interatomic potential energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently proposed "on-the-fly" learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration, Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools, including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu using DP-GEN.

This so-called embedded atom neural network (EANN) approach is inspired by the well-known empirical embedded atom method (EAM) model used in the condensed phase. It simply replaces the scalar embedded atom density in EAM with a Gaussian-type orbital based density vector and represents the complex relationship between the embedded density vector and atomic energy by neural networks. We demonstrate that the EANN approach is equally accurate as several established ML models in representing both big molecular and extended periodic systems, yet with much fewer parameters and configurations. It is highly efficient as it implicitly contains the three-body information without an explicit sum of the conventional costly angular descriptors. With high accuracy and efficiency, EANN potentials can vastly accelerate molecular dynamics and spectroscopic simulations in complex systems at ab initio level.},

The molecular structures of both light and heavy water are modeled by path-integral molecular dynamics based on the advanced deep-learning technique. The neural network is trained on ab initio data obtained with SCAN density functional theory. The experimentally observed isotope effect in x-ray absorption spectra is reproduced semiquantitatively in theory. Compared to the spectrum in normal water, the blueshifted and less pronounced pre- and main-edge in heavy water reflect that the heavy water is more structured at short- and intermediate-range of the hydrogen-bond network. In contrast, the isotope effect on the spectrum is negligible at post-edge, which is consistent with the identical long-range ordering in both liquids as observed in the diffraction experiment.},

The generative map from the latent space to the data space follows a dynamical system, where a learnable potential function guides a compressible fluid to flow towards the target density distribution. Training of the model amounts to solving an optimal control problem. The Monge-Ampère flow has tractable likelihoods and supports efficient sampling and inference. One can easily impose symmetry constraints in the generative model by designing suitable scalar potential functions. We apply the approach to unsupervised density estimation of the MNIST dataset and variational calculation of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical point. This approach brings insights and techniques from Monge-Ampère equation, optimal transport, and fluid dynamics into reversible flow-based generative models.},

  abstract = {A new approach for efficiently exploring the configuration space and computing the free energy of large atomic and molecular systems is proposed, motivated by an analogy with reinforcement learning. There are two major components in this new approach. Like metadynamics, it allows for an efficient exploration of the configuration space by adding an adaptively computed biasing potential to the original dynamics. Like deep reinforcement learning, this biasing potential is trained on the fly using deep neural networks, with data collected judiciously from the exploration and an uncertainty indicator from the neural network model playing the role of the reward function. Parameterization using neural networks makes it feasible to handle cases with a large set of collective variables. This has the potential advantage that selecting precisely the right set of collective variables has now become less critical for capturing the structural transformations of the system. The method is illustrated by studying the full-atom, explicit solvent models of alanine dipeptide and tripeptide, as well as the system of a polyalanine-10 molecule with 20 collective variables.},

Herein, we propose a deep learning based scheme called electron temperature dependent deep potential molecular dynamics (TDDPMD), which can be readily applied to study larger systems with longer trajectories, yielding more accurate properties. We take warm dense beryllium (Be) as an example with the training data from FPMD simulations spanning a wide range of temperatures (0.4–2500\,eV) and densities (3.50–8.25\,g/cm3). The TDDPMD method well reproduces the principal Hugoniot curve and radial distribution functions from the FPMD method. Furthermore, it depicts the reflection point of the Hugoniot curve more smoothly and provides more converged diffusion coefficients. We also show the new model can yield static structure factors and dynamic structure factors of warm dense Be.}
