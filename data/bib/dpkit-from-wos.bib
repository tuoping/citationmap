  abstract = {We propose Cormorant, a rotationally covariant neural network architecture for learning the behavior and properties of complex many-body physical systems. We apply these networks to molecular systems with two goals: learning atomic potential energy surfaces for use in Molecular Dynamics simulations, and learning ground state properties of molecules calculated by Density Functional Theory. Some of the key features of our network are that (a) each neuron explicitly corresponds to a subset of atoms; (b) the activation of each neuron is covariant to rotations, ensuring that overall the network is fully rotationally invariant. Furthermore, the non-linearity in our network is based upon tensor products and the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, allowing the network to operate entirely in Fourier space. Cormorant significantly outperforms competing algorithms in learning molecular Potential Energy Surfaces from conformational geometries in the MD-17 dataset, and is competitive with other methods at learning geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties of molecules on the GDB-9 dataset.},

  abstract = {We show that a deep-learning neural network potential (DP) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations can well describe Cu-Zr materials, an example of a binary alloy system, that can coexist in as ordered intermetallic and as an amorphous phase. The complex phase diagram for Cu-Zr makes it a challenging system for traditional atomistic force-fields that cannot accurately describe the different properties and phases. Instead, we show that a DP approach using a large database with ∼300k configurations can render results generally on par with DFT. The training set includes configurations of pristine and bulk elementary metals and intermetallic structures in the liquid and solid phases in addition to slab and amorphous configurations. The DP model was validated by comparing bulk properties such as lattice constants, elastic constants, bulk moduli, phonon spectra, and surface energies to DFT values for identical structures. Furthermore, we contrast the DP results with values obtained using well-established two embedded atom method potentials. Overall, our DP potential provides near DFT accuracy for the different Cu-Zr phases but with a fraction of its computational cost, thus enabling accurate computations of realistic atomistic models, especially for the amorphous phase.}

  abstract = {Materials composed of Ag, Au, and Ag–Au alloys remain of great interest despite decades of intense research scrutiny. We interpret these efforts as an impetus for developing robust, accurate, and relatively fast computational methods for modeling these materials. Herein, we describe the training, development, and validation of a machine learning deep neural-network potential (DNP) for improved modeling of Ag–Au systems. This DNP was iteratively trained using density functional theory (DFT) to produce a robust multi-length-scale potential, which yields results comparable to DFT on a wide range of properties such as equilibrium and nonequilibrium lattices, mechanical properties, and defect energies. Further, this DNP can well describe adatom (Ag or Au) energy barriers for diffusion on \{100\}-, \{110\}-, and \{111\}-terminated surfaces (Ag or Au), in agreement with previously reported works. We utilized the DNP to study the nucleation and growth of simulated seeded core–shell Ag and Au nanoparticles (NP). We show that both nanoalloys grow such that \{111\} facets significantly increase at the expense of the \{100\} ones. In contrast, the Ag core NP is found to have a more disordered inner structure than the Au one and that Ag adatoms in Au@Ag NP have a more pronounced penetration power than Au in Ag@Au NP. These findings are rationalized in terms of adatom adsorption and diffusion energies.},

  abstract = {In this work, an investigation of supercritical water is presented combining inelastic and deep inelastic neutron scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learned potential of ab initio quality. The local hydrogen dynamics is investigated at 250 bar and in the temperature range of 553-823 K, covering the evolution from subcritical liquid to supercritical gas-like water. The evolution of libration, bending, and stretching motions in the vibrational density of states is studied, analyzing the spectral features by a mode decomposition. Moreover, the hydrogen nuclear momentum distribution is measured, and its anisotropy is probed experimentally. It is shown that hydrogen bonds survive up to the higher temperatures investigated, and we discuss our results in the framework of the coupling between intramolecular modes and intermolecular librations. Results show that the local potential affecting hydrogen becomes less anisotropic within the molecular plane in the supercritical phase, and we attribute this result to the presence of more distorted hydrogen bonds.},

  abstract = {Modeling dynamical eects in chemical reactions, such as post-transition state bi-furcation, requires ab initio molecular dynamics simulations due to the breakdown of simpler static models like transition state theory. However, these simulations tend to be restricted to lower-accuracy electronic structure methods and scarce sampling be- cause of their high computational cost. Here, we report the use of statistical learning to accelerate reactive molecular dynamics simulations by combining high-throughput ab initio calculations, graph-convolution interatomic potentials and active learning. This pipeline was demonstrated on an ambimodal trispericyclic reaction involving 8,8-dicyanoheptafulvene and 6,6-dimethylfulvene. With a dataset size of approximately 31,000 M062X/def2-SVP quantum mechanical calculations, the computational cost of exploring the reactive potential energy surface was reduced by an order of magnitude. Thousands of virtually costless picosecond-long reactive trajectories suggest that post-transition state bifurcation plays a minor role for the reaction in vacuum. Furthermore, a transfer-learning strategy effectively upgraded the potential energy surface to higher levels of theory ((SMD-)M06-2X/def2-TZVPD in vacuum and three other solvents, as well as the more accurate DLPNO-DSD-PBEP86 D3BJ/def2-TZVPD) using about 10\% additional calculations for each surface. Since the larger basis set and the dynamic correlation capture intramolecular non-covalent interactions more accurately, they uncover longer lifetimes for the charge-separated intermediate on the more accurate potential energy surfaces. The character of the intermediate switches from entropic to thermodynamic upon including implicit solvation effects, with lifetimes increasing with solvent polarity. Analysis of 2,000 reactive trajectories on the chloroform PES shows a qualitative agreement with the experimentally-reported periselectivity for this reaction. This overall approach is broadly applicable and opens a door to the study of dynamical effects in larger, previously-intractable reactive systems.},

  abstract = {Modeling dynamical effects in chemical reactions typically requires ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations due to the breakdown of transition state theory (TST). Reactive AIMD simulations are limited to lower-accuracy electronic structure methods and weak statistics because quantum mechanical energies and forces must be evaluated at femtosecond time resolution over many replicas. We report a data-driven pipeline that allows for the treatment of dynamical effects with the same level of theory and overall cost as that of TST approaches. High-throughput ab initio calculations and autonomous data acquisition are coupled to graph convolutional neural-network interatomic potentials, allowing for inexpensive reactive AIMD simulations at quantum mechanical accuracy. We demonstrate the approach by accurately simulating post-TS dynamical effects in three distinct pericyclic reactions, including a challenging trispericyclic reaction with a complex bifurcating potential energy surface. This approach is broadly applicable to understanding dynamical effects and predicting reaction outcomes in large, previously intractable systems.},

  abstract = {Quantum-mechanically driven charge polarization and charge transfer are ubiquitous in biomolecular systems, controlling reaction rates, allosteric interactions, ligand-protein binding, membrane transport, and dynamically driven structural transformations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of these processes require quantum mechanical (QM) information in order to accurately describe their reactive dynamics. However, current techniques-empirical force fields, subsystem approaches, ab initio MD, and machine learning-vary in their ability to achieve a consistent chemical description across multiple atom types, and at scale. Here we present a physics-based, atomistic force field, the ensemble DFT charge-transfer embedded-atom method, in which QM forces are described at a uniform level of theory across all atoms, avoiding the need for explicit solution of the Schrodinger equation or large, precomputed training data sets. Coupling between the electronic and atomistic length scales is effected through an ensemble density functional theory formulation of the embedded-atom method originally developed for elemental materials. Charge transfer is expressed in terms of ensembles of ionic state basis densities of individual atoms, and charge polarization, in terms of atomic excited-state basis densities. This provides a highly compact yet general representation of the force field, encompassing both local and system-wide effects. Charge rearrangement is realized through the evolution of ensemble weights, adjusted at each dynamical time step via chemical potential equalization.},

A key point in developing such potentials is the preparation of a training dataset of ab initio trajectories. Here we apply a deep potential molecular dynamics (DeePMD) approach to develop NNP for silica, which is the representative glassformer widely used as a model system for simulating network-forming liquids and glasses. We show that the use of a relatively small training dataset of high-temperature ab initio configurations is enough to fabricate NNP, which describes well both structural and dynamical properties of liquid silica. In particular, we calculate the pair correlation functions, angular distribution function, velocity autocorrelation functions, vibrational density of states, and mean-square displacement and reveal a close agreement with ab initio data. We show that NNP allows us to expand significantly the time-space scales achievable in simulations and thus calculating dynamical and transport properties with more accuracy than that for ab initio methods. We find that developed NNP allows us to describe the structure of the glassy silica with satisfactory accuracy even though no low-temperature configurations were included in the training procedure. The results obtained open up prospects for simulating structural and dynamical properties of liquids and glasses via NNP.},

The high accuracies of second- and third-order force constants from the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) are demonstrated with phonon dispersion, Gruneisen parameter, three-phonon scattering rate, phonon-vacancy scattering rate, and thermal conductivity, all of which are very close to the results from density functional theory calculations. We also show that the widely used empirical potentials (Stillinger-Weber and Tersoff) produce much larger errors compared to the GAP. The computational cost of GAP is higher than the two empirical potentials, but five orders of magnitude lower than density functional theory calculations. Our work shows that GAP can provide a new opportunity for studying phonon transport in partially disordered crystalline phases with the high predictive power of ab initio calculation but at a feasible computational cost.},

We demonstrated that the presence of structure motifs and their connections in a large set of crystalline compounds can be converted into unique vector representations using an unsupervised learning algorithm. To demonstrate the use of structure motif information, a motif-centric learning framework is created by combining motif information with the atom-based graph neural networks to form an atom-motif dual graph network (AMDNet), which is more accurate in predicting the electronic structures of metal oxides such as bandgaps. The work illustrates the route toward fundamental design of graph neural network learning architecture for complex materials by incorporating beyond-atom physical principles.},

The CNN implicitly establishes the low-dimensional features needed to correlate each atomic neighborhood to its net atomic force. The selection of the salient features of the atomic structure (i.e., feature engineering) in the VASt framework is implicit, comprehensive, automated, scalable, and highly efficient. The calibrated convolutional layers learn the complex spatial relationships and multibody interactions that govern the physics of atomic systems with remarkable fidelity.

Techniques based on machine-learning ideas for interpolating the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface without explicitly describing electrons have recently shown great promise, but accurately and efficiently fitting the physically relevant space of configurations remains a challenging goal. Here, we present a Gaussian approximation potential for silicon that achieves this milestone, accurately reproducing density-functional-theory reference results for a wide range of observable properties, including crystal, liquid, and amorphous bulk phases, as well as point, line, and plane defects. We demonstrate that this new potential enables calculations such as finite-temperature phase-boundary lines, self-diffusivity in the liquid, formation of the amorphous by slow quench, and dynamic brittle fracture, all of which are very expensive with a first-principles method. We show that the uncertainty quantification inherent to the Gaussian process regression framework gives a qualitative estimate of the potential’s accuracy for a given atomic configuration. The success of this model shows that it is indeed possible to create a useful machine-learning-based interatomic potential that comprehensively describes a material on the atomic scale and serves as a template for the development of such models in the future.},

There are various flavors of MD ranging from the high fidelity albeit computationally expensive ab initio MD to relatively lower fidelity but much more efficient classical MD such as atomistic and coarse-grained models. Each of these different flavors of MD have been independently used by materials scientists to bring about breakthroughs in materials discovery and design. A significant gulf exists between the various MD flavors, each having varying levels of fidelity. The accuracy of DFT or ab initio MD is generally much higher than that of classical atomistic simulations which is higher than that of coarse-grained models. Multi-fidelity scale bridging to combine the accuracy and flexibility of ab initio MD with efficiency classical MD has been a longstanding goal. The advent of big-data analytics has brought to the forefront powerful machine learning methods that can be deployed to achieve this goal. Here, we provide our perspective on the challenges in multi-fidelity scale bridging and trace the developments leading up to the use of machine learning algorithms and data-science towards addressing this grand challenge.},

  abstract = {Interatomic potential models based on machine learning (ML) are rapidly developing as tools for material simulations. However, because of their flexibility, they require large fitting databases that are normally created with substantial manual selection and tuning of reference configurations. Here, we show that ML potentials can be built in a largely automated fashion, exploring and fitting potential-energy surfaces from the beginning (de novo) within one and the same protocol. The key enabling step is the use of a configuration-averaged kernel metric that allows one to select the few most relevant and diverse structures at each step. The resulting potentials are accurate and robust for the wide range of configurations that occur during structure searching, despite only requiring a relatively small number of single-point DFT calculations on small unit cells. We apply the method to materials with diverse chemical nature and coordination environments, marking an important step toward the more routine application of ML potentials in physics, chemistry, and materials science.},

  abstract = {Understanding and controlling the complex and dynamic processes at battery interfaces holds the key to developing more durable and ultra high performance secondary batteries. Interfacial processes like dendrite and Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) formation span numerous time-and length scales, and despite decades of research, their formation, composition, structure and function still pose a conundrum. Consequently, "inverse design" of high-performance interfaces and interphases like the SEI, remains an elusive dream. Here, we present a perspective and possible blueprint for a future battery research strategy to reach this ambitious goal. Semi-supervised generative deep learning models trained on all sources of available data, i.e., extensive multifidelity datasets from multi-scale computer simulations and databases, operando characterization from largescale research facilities, high-throughput synthesis and laboratory testing, need to work closely together to unlock this dream. We show how understanding and tracking different types of uncertainties in the experimental and simulation methods, as well as the machine learning framework for the generative model, is crucial for controlling and improving the fidelity in the predictive design of battery interfaces and interphases. We argue that simultaneous utilization of data from multiple domains, including data from failed experiments, will play a critical role in accelerating the development of reliable generative models to enable accelerated discovery and inverse design of durable ultra high performance batteries based on novel materials, structures and designs.},

  abstract = {Generating independent configurations sampled from the physical Boltzmann distribution is an extremely difficult task, owing to the incredibly small volume in configuration space that high probability states (e.g. the folded state of a protein) occupy. Consequently, classical sampling of such Boltzmann distributions relies on the use of either Monte Carlo (MC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to slowly propagate a valid initial configuration forward in time, which is a slow and computationally expensive process. We employ here a neural network based approach to generate statistically independent configurations of various physical models in hopes of improving sampling efficiency of such states. We first show that our trained Boltzmann generator model can quantitatively recreate an analytical solution for the free energy of a double-well potential/ We then proceed to apply our Boltzmann generator to a simple harmonic oscillator confined in a box, and show that the agreement between generated samples and the analytical result converges as training proceeds. We conclude our report with perspectives on ongoing and future work.},

While unfolding its search, the method actively learns a surrogate model of the potential energy landscape on which it performs a number of local relaxations (exploitation) and further structural searches (exploration). Assuming Gaussian processes, deploying two separate kernel widths to better capture rough features of the energy landscape while retaining a good resolution of local minima, an acquisition function is used to decide on which of the resulting structures is the more promising and should be treated at the first-principles level. The method is demonstrated to outperform by 2 orders of magnitude a well established first-principles based evolutionary algorithm in finding surface reconstructions. Finally, global optimization with first-principles energy expressions is utilized to identify initial stages of the edge oxidation and oxygen intercalation of graphene sheets on the Ir(111) surface.}

In this submission, we revisit a machine learning model capable of learning the electron density and the corresponding energy functional based on a set of training examples. It allows us to bypass solving the Kohn-Sham equations, providing a significant decrease in computation time.

Ab initio methods, such as coupled-cluster, routinely produce much higher accuracy, but computational costs limit their application to small molecules. In this paper, we leverage machine learning to calculate coupled-cluster energies from DFT densities, reaching quantum chemical accuracy (errors below 1 kcal . mol(-1)) on test data. Moreover, density-based Delta -learning (learning only the correction to a standard DFT calculation, termed Delta -DFT ) significantly reduces the amount of training data required, particularly when molecular symmetries are included. The robustness of Delta -DFT is highlighted by correcting "on the fly" DFT-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of resorcinol (C6H4(OH)(2)) to obtain MD trajectories with coupled-cluster accuracy. We conclude, therefore, that Delta -DFT facilitates running gas-phase MD simulations with quantum chemical accuracy, even for strained geometries and conformer changes where standard DFT fails. High-level ab initio quantum chemical methods carry a high computational burden, thus limiting their applicability. Here, the authors employ machine learning to generate coupled-cluster energies and forces at chemical accuracy for geometry optimization and molecular dynamics from DFT densities.},

  abstract = {Sampling complex free-energy surfaces is one of the main challenges of modern atomistic simulation methods. The presence of kinetic bottlenecks in such surfaces often renders a direct approach useless. A popular strategy is to identify a small number of key collective variables and to introduce a bias potential that is able to favor their fluctuations in order to accelerate sampling. Here, we propose to use machine-learning techniques in conjunction with the recent variationally enhanced sampling method [O. Valsson, M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 090601 (2014)] in order to determine such potential. This is achieved by expressing the bias as a neural network. The parameters are determined in a variational learning scheme aimed at minimizing an appropriate functional. This required the development of a more efficient minimization technique. The expressivity of neural networks allows representing rapidly varying free-energy surfaces, removes boundary effects artifacts, and allows several collective variables to be handled.},

On the other hand, nucleation is a rare event that occurs in much longer timescales than those achievable by ab-initio molecular dynamics. To address this problem, we train a deep neural network potential based on a set of data generated by Metadynamics simulations using a classical potential. We show how this is an effective way to collect all the relevant data for the process of interest. In order to drive efficiently the crystallization process, we introduce a new collective variable based on the Debye structure factor. We are able to encode the long-range order information in a local variable which is better suited to describe the nucleation dynamics. The reference energies are then calculated using the SCAN exchange-correlation functional, which is able to get a better description of the bonding complexity of the Si phase diagram. Finally, we recover the free energy surface with a DFT accuracy, and we compute the thermodynamics properties near the melting point, obtaining a good agreement with experimental data. In addition, we study the early stages of the crystallization process, unveiling features of the nucleation mechanism.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) empowers biomedical systems with the capability to optimize their performance through modeling of the available data extremely well, without using strong assumptions about the modeled system. Especially in nanoscale biosystems, where the generated data sets are too vast and complex to mentally parse without computational assist, ML is instrumental in analyzing and extracting new insights, accelerating material and structure discoveries and designing experience as well as supporting nano-scale communications and networks. However, despite these efforts, the use of ML in nano-scale biomedical engineering remains still under-explored in certain areas and research challenges are still open in fields such as structure and material design and simulations, communications and signal processing, and bio-medicine applications. In this article, we review the existing research regarding the use of ML in nano-scale biomedical engineering. In more detail, we first identify and discuss the main challenges that can be formulated as ML problems. These challenges are classified in three main categories: structure and material design and simulation, communications and signal processing and biomedicine applications. Next, we discuss the state of the art ML methodologies that are used to countermeasure the aforementioned challenges. For each of the presented methodologies, special emphasis is given to its principles, applications and limitations. Finally, we conclude the article with insightful discussions, that reveal research gaps and highlight possible future research directions.},

A classic case of difficult phase transformations is the nucleation of strengthening precipitates in high-strength lightweight aluminium alloys. Here, using a combination of atomic-scale imaging, simulations and classical nucleation theory calculations, we investigate the nucleation of the strengthening phase theta' onto a template structure in the aluminium-copper alloy system. We show that this transformation can be promoted in samples exhibiting at least one nanoscale dimension, with extremely high nucleation rates for the strengthening phase as well as for an unexpected phase. This template-directed solid-state nucleation pathway is enabled by the large influx of surface vacancies that results from heating a nanoscale solid. Template-directed nucleation is replicated in a bulk alloy as well as under electron irradiation, implying that this difficult transformation can be facilitated under the general condition of sustained excess vacancy concentrations.},

Besides providing all the necessary computational tools for generating TTM-nrg and MB-nrg PEFs, MB-Fit provides a seamless interface with the MBX software, a many-body energy/force calculator for computer simulations. Given the demonstrated accuracy of the MB-PEFs, we believe that MB-Fit will enable routine, predictive computer simulations of generic (small) molecules in the gas, liquid, and solid phases, including, but not limited to, the modeling of isomeric equilibria in molecular clusters, solvation processes, molecular crystals, and phase diagrams.},

  abstract = {Amorphous TiO2 (a-TiO2) is widely used in many fields, ranging from photoelectrochemistry to bioengineering, hence detailed knowledge of its atomic structure is of scientific and technological interest. Here we use an ab initio-based deep neural network potential (DP) to simulate large scale atomic models of crystalline and disordered TiO2 with molecular dynamics. Our DP reproduces the structural properties of all 11 TiO2 crystalline phases, predicts the densities and structure factors of molten and amorphous TiO2 with only a few percent deviation from experiments, and describes the pressure dependence of the amorphous structure in agreement with recent observations. It can be extended to model additional structures and compositions, and can be thus of great value in the study of TiO2-based nanomaterials.},

Specifically, the predicted spectra reproduce nearly all prominent peaks, with 90\% of the predicted peak locations within 1 eVof the ground truth. Besides its own utility in spectral analysis and structure inference, our method can be combined with structure search algorithms to enable high-throughput spectrum sampling of the vast material configuration space, which opens up new pathways to material design and discovery.},

However, the high computational cost of such methods hinders their broad applicability, in particular for finite- temperature molecular dynamics simulations. We propose a method that couples machine learning techniques with thermodynamic perturbation theory to estimate finite-temperature properties using correlated approximations. We apply this approach to compute the enthalpies of adsorption in zeolites and show that reliable estimates can be obtained by training a machine learning model with as few as 10 RPA energies.

  abstract = {Machine learning has demonstrated great power in materials design, discovery, and property prediction. However, despite the success of machine learning in predicting discrete properties, challenges remain for continuous property prediction. The challenge is aggravated in crystalline solids due to crystallographic symmetry considerations and data scarcity. Here, the direct prediction of phonon density-of-states (DOS) is demonstrated using only atomic species and positions as input. Euclidean neural networks are applied, which by construction are equivariant to 3D rotations, translations, and inversion and thereby capture full crystal symmetry, and achieve high-quality prediction using a small training set of ≈ 10 3 examples with over 64 atom types. The predictive model reproduces key features of experimental data and even generalizes to materials with unseen elements, and is naturally suited to efficiently predict alloy systems without additional computational cost. The potential of the network is demonstrated by predicting a broad number of high phononic specific heat capacity materials. The work indicates an efficient approach to explore materials' phonon structure, and can further enable rapid screening for high-performance thermal storage materials and phonon-mediated superconductors. The ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under https://doi. One central objective of materials science is to establish structure-property relationships; that is, how specific atomic arrangements lead to certain macroscopic functionalities. This question is historically addressed through trial-and-error of a combination of structure and property characterization, theory, and calculation. However, recent advances in machine learning (ML) suggest a paradigm shift in how structure-property relationships can be directly constructed. [1,2] To date, ML has seen success in a growing spectrum of materials applications, including materials discovery and design, [3-6] process automation and optimization, [7,8] and prediction of materials' mechanical (elastic moduli), [9-12] thermodynamic and thermal transport (formation enthalpy, thermal conductivity, Debye temperature, heat capacity), [10,12-16] and electronic (bandgap, superconductivity, topology) properties, [11,17-24] and atomistic},

Theoretical studies based on quantum-mechanical first-principles calculations can provide this knowledge but at an immense computational cost. In recent years, machine learning has been successful in predicting structural properties at a much lower cost. Here we propose a simplified structure descriptor with no empirical parameters, "k-Bags", together with a scalable and comprehensive machine learning framework that can deepen our understanding of atomic properties of structures. This model can readily predict structure-energy relations that can provide results close to the accuracy of ab initio methods. The model provides chemically meaningful atomic energies enabling theoretical analysis of organic and inorganic molecular structures. Utilization of the local information provided by the atomic energies significantly improves upon the stochastic steps in our evolutionary global structure optimization, resulting in a much faster global minimum search of molecules, clusters, and surfaced supported species.},

This MLEBF method has been demonstrated to provide highly accurate energies and gradients. In this work, we have further derived the MLEBF method with which highly accurate excited-state Hessian matrices of large systems are efficiently constructed. Moreover, in combination with recently proposed embedded atom neural network (EANN) model we have developed a machine learning (ML) accelerated MLEBF method (i.e., ML-MLEBF) in which photochemically inert region is entirely replaced with trained ML models. ML-MLEBF is found to improve computational efficiency of Hessian matrices in particular for large systems. Furthermore, both MLEBF and ML-MLEBF methods are highly parallel and exhibit low-scaling computational cost with multiple CPUs. The present developments could motivate combining various ML techniques with fragment-based electronic structure methods to explore Hessian-matrix-based excited-state properties of large systems.},

  abstract = {Main observation and conclusion As a common electrocatalytic system, Au-Pt alloy particles are often prepared as Au-core-Pt-shell (Au@Pt) to make full use of platinum. However, Au has a strong tendency to segregate to the outer surface, leading to the redistribution of the active sites. Unfortunately, the mechanism of such reconstruction and its effect on the electrocatalytic activity have not been thoroughly discussed, largely owing to the complexity of in-situ characterization and computational modeling. Herein, by taking the 55-atom Au13Pt42 core-shell nanocluster as an example, we utilized the neural network potential at DFT level and the genetic algorithm to search the complex global configurational space. It turns out that it is thermodynamically favorable when all gold atoms are segregated to the surface and the shape of the cluster tends to change from icosahedron to a distorted amorphous structure (at a reduced core, DRC) with a unique gold distribution. Towards understanding the dynamic activity variation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on this bimetallic Au@Pt system, oxygen adsorption energy calculations show that this reconstruction could not only increase the number of adsorption sites but also dramatically improve the ORR catalytic activity of each site, thus enhance the overall ORR reactivity.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) in the representation of molecular-orbital-based (MOB) features has been shown to be an accurate and transferable approach to the prediction of post-Hartree-Fock correlation energies. Previous applications of MOB-ML employed Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which provides good prediction accuracy with small training sets; however, the cost of GPR training scales cubically with the amount of data and becomes a computational bottleneck for large training sets. In the current work, we address this problem by introducing a clustering/regression/classification implementation of MOB-ML. In the first step, regression clustering (RC) is used to partition the training data to best fit an ensemble of linear regression (LR) models; in the second step, each cluster is regressed independently, using either LR or GPR; and in the third step, a random forest classifier (RFC) is trained for the prediction of cluster assignments based on MOB feature values. Upon inspection, RC is found to recapitulate chemically intuitive groupings of the frontier molecular orbitals, and the combined RC/LR/RFC and RC/GPR/RFC implementations of MOB-ML are found to provide good prediction accuracy with greatly reduced wall-clock training times. For a data set of thermalized (350 K) geometries of 7211 organic molecules of up to seven heavy atoms (QM7b-T), both RC/LR/RFC and RC/GPR/RFC reach chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol prediction error) with only 300 training molecules, while providing 35000-fold and 4500-fold reductions in the wall-clock training time, respectively, compared to MOB-ML without clustering. The resulting models are also demonstrated to retain transferability for the prediction of large-molecule energies with only small-molecule training data. Finally, it is shown that capping the number of training data points per cluster leads to further improvements in prediction accuracy with negligible increases in wall-clock training time.},

Strikingly, for the second-order Moller-Plessett perturbation theory, coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD), and CCSD with perturbative triples levels of theory, it is shown that the thermally accessible (350 K) potential energy surface for a single water molecule can be described to within 1 mhartree using a model that is trained from only a single reference calculation at a randomized geometry. To explore the breadth of chemical diversity that can be described, MOB-ML is also applied to a new dataset of thermalized (350 K) geometries of 7211 organic models with up to seven heavy atoms. In comparison with the previously reported Delta-ML method, MOB-ML is shown to reach chemical accuracy with threefold fewer training geometries. Finally, a transferability test in which models trained for seven-heavy-atom systems are used to predict energies for thirteen-heavy-atom systems reveals that MOB-ML reaches chemical accuracy with 36-fold fewer training calculations than Delta-ML (140 vs 5000 training calculations).

This paper derives complexity estimates of the solutions of d-dimensional second-order elliptic PDEs in the Barron space, that is a set of functions admitting the integral of certain parametric ridge function against a probability measure on the parameters. We prove under some appropriate assumptions that if the coefficients and the source term of the elliptic PDE lie in Barron spaces, then the solution of the PDE is ǫ-close with respect to the H1 norm to a Barron function. Moreover, we prove dimension-explicit bounds for the Barron norm of this approximate solution, depending at most polynomially on the dimension d of the PDE. As a direct consequence of the complexity estimates, the solution of the PDE can be approximated on any bounded domain by a two-layer neural network with respect to the H1 norm with a dimension-explicit convergence rate.},

  abstract = {Atomistic modeling is important for studying physical and chemical properties of materials. Recently, machine learning interaction potentials have gained much more attentions as they can provide density functional theory level predictions within negligible time. The symmetry function descriptor based atomistic neural network is the most widely used model for modeling alloys. To precisely describe complex potential energy surfaces, integrating advanced metrics, such as force or virial stress, into training can be of great help. In this work, we propose a virtual-atom approach to model the total energy of symmetry function descriptors based atomistic neural network. Our approach creates the computation graph directly from atomic positions. Thus, the derivations of forces and virial can be handled by TensorFlow automatically and efficiently. The virtual atom approach with AutoGrad within TensorFlow allows for efficient training to not just energies and forces, but also virial stress. This new approach is implemented in our open-source program TensorAlloy, which supports constructing machine learning interaction potentials for both molecules and solids. The QM7 and SNAP/Ni-Mo datasets are used to demonstrate the performances of our program. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

MD simulation investigations provide massive data about the movements of PNCs beads on the micro-level. However, there are many challenges involved in correctly understanding and predicting the performance and properties of molecules from these massive MD simulation data. Traditional data-driven techniques are limited due to computational expense, required accuracy, and the availability of high-dimensional PNCs structures. Machine learning can give an effort to process massive data, but not all machine learning methods are available for all occasions; domain knowledge or manual intervention is required. Here, we aim to investigate unsupervised machine learning algorithms to discover clustering and shaping movements of PNCs beads under tension. Cluster Envelope Shaping Method (CESM) was proposed to analyze the clustering of beads and the shaping of clusters based on MD simulation data. The matrix-free PNC based elastomer simulation and Single-Chain Polymer Nanoparticles simulation, which demonstrate two types of deformations, verified the validity of this method.},

  abstract = {We propose a global optimization strategy for atomistic structure determination based on two new concepts: a few-atom complementary energy landscape and atomic role models. Global optimization of costly energy expressions may be aided by performing some of the optimization on model energy landscapes. These are often based on a sum-of-atomic-contributions form that accurately reproduces every local energy minimum of the true energy expression. However, we propose that, by not including all atomic contributions, the resulting energy landscapes may become more convex, making the search for the global optimum more facile. A role model is someone we aspire to be more like; in the same vein we define the role model of an atom to be another atom whose local environment the first atom seeks to obtain itself. Basing a complementary energy landscape on the distance of some atoms from their role models in a feature space, we arrive at a useful few-atom complementary energy landscape. We show that relaxation in this landscape is an effective mutation when employed in an evolutionary algorithm used to identify the bulk cristobalite structure of SiO2 and the (1 x 4) surface reconstruction of anatase TiO2 (001).},

We discuss how such constraints are recovered and incorporated into ML models. Specifically, we use conservation of energy – a fundamental property of closed classical and quantum mechanical systems – to derive an efficient gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) model. The challenge of constructing conservative force fields is accomplished by learning in a Hilbert space of vectorvalued functions that obey the law of energy conservation. We proceed with the development of a multi-partite matching algorithm that enables a fully automated recovery of physically relevant point-group and fluxional symmetries from the training dataset into a symmetric variant of our model. The developed symmetric GDML (sGDML) approach is able to faithfully reproduce global force fields at the accuracy high-level ab initio methods, thus enabling sample intensive tasks like molecular dynamics simulations at that level of accuracy.},

Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules.

We develop a scheme named randomized atomic-system generator to produce the training sets that widely cover the potential energy surface by combining the random sampling and structural optimization. We apply the scheme to construct the machine learning potentials for simulation of chalcogen-based phase change materials. Constructed machine-learning potentials successfully simulate the dynamics of melting and crystallization processes of binary GeTe at a level comparable to first-principles simulations. The visual analysis shows that the RAG-generated training set represents the crystallization process including the amorphous phases.

FCHL19 is a revision of our previous work [F. A. Faber et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241717 (2018)] where the representation is discretized and the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed phase for a set of water clusters with a mean absolute error (MAE) binding energy error of less than 0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3200 samples. For force learning on the MD 17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art accuracy with a regressor based on Gaussian process regression. When the revised FCHL19 representation is combined with the operator quantum machine learning regressor, forces and energies can be predicted in only a few milliseconds per atom.

This is particularly pronounced under the periodic boundary conditions commonly used in molecular simulations. In this article, the dielectric properties of a water model whose intermolecular electrostatic interactions are entirely short-ranged are investigated. This is done within the framework of local molecular-field theory (LMFT), which provides a well-controlled mean-field treatment of long-ranged electrostatics. This short-ranged model gives a remarkably good performance on a number of counts, and its apparent shortcomings are readily accounted for. These results not only lend support to LMFT as an approach for understanding solvation behavior, but also are relevant to those developing interaction potentials based on local descriptions of liquid structure.},

  abstract = {Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is an important intermediate in the atmospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides. Although there has been much research, the processes that govern the physical interactions between N2O5 and water are still not fully understood at a molecular level. Gaining a quantitative insight from computer simulations requires going beyond the accuracy of classical force fields while accessing length scales and time scales that are out of reach for high-level quantum-chemical approaches. To this end, we present the development of MB-nrg many-body potential energy functions for nonreactive simulations of N2O5 in water. This MB-nrg model is based on electronic structure calculations at the coupled cluster level of theory and is compatible with the successful MB-pol model for water. It provides a physically correct description of long-range many-body interactions in combination with an explicit representation of up to threebody short-range interactions in terms of multidimensional permutationally invariant polynomials. In order to further investigate the importance of the underlying interactions in the model, a TTM-nrg model was also devised. TTM-nrg is a more simplistic representation that contains only two-body short-range interactions represented through Born-Mayer functions. In this work, an active learning approach was employed to efficiently build representative training sets of monomer, dimer, and trimer structures, and benchmarks are presented to determine the accuracy of our new models in comparison to a range of density functional theory methods. By assessing the binding curves, distortion energies of N2O5, and interaction energies in clusters of N2O5 and water, we evaluate the importance of two-body and three-body short-range potentials. The results demonstrate that our MB-nrg model has high accuracy with respect to the coupled cluster reference, outperforms current density functional theory models, and thus enables highly accurate simulations of N2O5 in aqueous environments.},

  abstract = {We present an analytical model representation of the electron density rho(r) in molecules in the form of expansions of a few functions (exponentials and a Gaussian) per atom. Based on a former analytical model of rho(r) in atoms, we devised its molecular implementation by introducing the anisotropy inherent in the electron distribution of atoms in molecules by means of proper anisotropic functions. The resulting model named A2MD (anisotropic analytical model of density) takes an analytical form highly suitable for obtaining the electron density in large biomolecules as its computational cost scales linearly with the number of atoms. To obtain the parameters of the model, we first devised a fitting procedure to reference electron densities obtained in ab initio correlated quantum calculations. Second, in order to skip costly ab initio calculations, we also developed a machine learning (ML)-based predictor that used neural networks trained on broad molecular datasets to determine the parameters of the model. The resulting ML methodology that we named A2MDnet (A2MD network-trained) was able to provide reliable electron densities as a basis to predict molecular features without requiring quantum calculations. The results presented together with the low computational scaling associated to the A2MD representation of rho(r) suggest potential applications to obtain reliable electron densities and rho(r)-based molecular properties in biomacromolecules.},

The learning algorithm has the possibility of querying a limited number of samples to obtain the corresponding labels, subsequently used for supervised learning. In this work, we consider the task of choosing the subset of samples to be labeled from a fixed finite pool of samples. We assume the pool of samples to be a random matrix and the ground truth labels to be generated by a single-layer teacher random neural network. We employ replica methods to analyze the large deviations for the accuracy achieved after supervised learning on a subset of the original pool. These large deviations then provide optimal achievable performance boundaries for any active learning algorithm. We show that the optimal learning performance can be efficiently approached by simple message-passing active learning algorithms. We also provide a comparison with the performance of some other popular active learning strategies.},

Understanding the composition-structure-property relationship of grain boundaries is a key avenue for tailoring and designing high performance materials. In this work, we studied segregation of W into ZrB2 grain boundaries by a hybrid method combining Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD), and examined the effects of segregation on grain boundary strengths by MD tensile testing with a fitted machine learning potential. It is found that W prefers grain boundary sites with local compression strains due to its smaller size compared to Zr. Rich segregation patterns (including monolayer, off-center bilayer, and other complex patterns); segregation induced grain boundary structure reconstruction; and order-disorder like segregation pattern transformation are discovered. Strong segregation tendency of W into ZrB2 grain boundaries and significant improvements on grain boundary strengths are certified, which guarantees outstanding high temperature performance of ZrB2-based UHTCs.},

  abstract = {High entropy diborides are new categories of ultra-high temperature ceramics, which are believed promising candidates for applications in hypersonic vehicles. However, knowledge on high temperature thermal and mechanical properties of high entropy diborides is still lacking unit now. In this work, variations of thermal and elastic properties of high entropy (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B-2 with respect to temperature were predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. Firstly, a deep learning potential for Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-B diboride system was fitted with its prediction error in energy and force respectively being 9.2 meV/atom and 208 meV/A, in comparison with first-principles calculations. Then, temperature dependent lattice constants, anisotropic thermal expansions, anisotropic phonon thermal conductivities, and elastic properties of high entropy (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B-2 from 0 degrees C to 2400 degrees C were evaluated, where the predicted room temperature values agree well with experimental measurements. In addition, intrinsic lattice distortions of (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B-2 were analyzed by displacements of atoms from their ideal positions, which are in an order of 10(-3) A and one order of magnitude smaller than those in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C. It indicates that lattice distortions in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B-2 is not so severe as expected. With the new paradigm of machine learning potential, deep insight into high entropy materials can be achieved in the future, since the chemical and structural complexly in high entropy materials can be well handled by machine learning potential.

  abstract = {High entropy materials (HEMs, e.g. high entropy alloys, high entropy ceramics) have gained increasing interests due to the possibility that they can provide challenge properties unattainable by traditional materials. Though a large number of HEMs have emerged, there is still in lack of theoretical predictions and simulations on HEMs, which is probably caused by the chemical complexity of HEMs. In this work, we demonstrate that the machine learning potentials developed in recent years can overcome the complexity of HEMs, and serve as powerful theoretical tools to simulate HEMs. A deep learning potential (DLP) for high entropy (Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C is fitted with the prediction error in energy and force being 9.4 meV/atom and 217 meV/A, respectively. The reliability and generality of the DLP are affirmed, since it can accurately predict lattice parameters and elastic constants of mono-phase carbides TMC (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta). Lattice constants (increase from 4.5707 A to 4.6727 A), thermal expansion coefficients (increase from 7.85x10(-6) K-1 to 10.58 x 10(-6) K-1), phonon thermal conductivities (decrease from 2.02 W m(-1) K-1 to 0.95 W m(-1) K-1), and elastic properties of high entropy (Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C in temperature ranging from 0 degrees C to 2400 degrees C are predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. The predicted room temperature properties agree well with experimental measurements, indicating the high accuracy of the DLP. With introducing of machine learning potentials, many problems that are intractable by traditional methods can be handled now. It is hopeful that deep insight into HEMs can be obtained in the future by such powerful methods.

  abstract = {As one of the most abundant materials on Earth, silica has been widely studied in various crystal structures and glassy states. However, in terms of molecular structure and the corresponding mechanical properties between those of ordered and disordered states, partially ordered silica states are not well-explored in the relevant literature owing to a low probability of appearance in experiments and simulations. The lack of this knowledge significantly hinders the understanding of the inherent mechanism of mechanical properties and limits the applications in many engineering fields. In this study, we present an exploration of the complex interdependent relations of the structural properties of silica over a wide range of free energy surfaces and establish a machine learning-based prediction model via high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations coupling with an enhanced sampling method. Each scale of structure information of samples with varying crystallinity is analyzed. First, descriptors of silica structures were identified and selected as inputs to a deep neural network (DNN). The results indicate that our DNN-based approach can provide an accurate prediction of bulk modulus, shear modulus, and tensile strength of silica samples. Furthermore, the generalizability of the machine learning model is verified on the prediction tasks for much larger silica systems, as well as silica quenched at varying cooling rates. Overall, the enhanced sampling method can reliably accelerate the exploration of free energy surfaces and collection of training samples, and machine learning methods are effective in generating accurate and reliable predictions of mechanical properties of materials over the free energy surface.},

  abstract = {Elemental phosphorus is attracting growing interest across fundamental and applied fields of research. However, atomistic simulations of phosphorus have remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we show that a universally applicable force field for phosphorus can be created by machine learning (ML) from a suitably chosen ensemble of quantum-mechanical results. Our model is fitted to density-functional theory plus many-body dispersion (DFT+MBD) data; its accuracy is demonstrated for the exfoliation of black and violet phosphorus (yielding monolayers of "phosphorene" and "hittorfene"); its transferability is shown for the transition between the molecular and network liquid phases. An application to a phosphorene nanoribbon on an experimentally relevant length scale exemplifies the power of accurate and flexible ML-driven force fields for next-generation materials modelling. The methodology promises new insights into phosphorus as well as other structurally complex, e.g., layered solids that are relevant in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science. Atomistic simulations of phosphorus represent a challenge due to the element's highly diverse allotropic structures. Here the authors propose a general-purpose machine-learning force field for elemental phosphorus, which can describe a broad range of relevant bulk and nanostructured allotropes.},

The key to achieve this mix is to use a standard density functional theory (DFT) simulation as a preprocessor for the atomic and molecular information, obtaining a good quality electronic density. General, symmetry preserving, atom-centered electronic descriptors are then built from this density to train a neural network to correct the baseline DFT energies and forces. These electronic descriptors encode much more information than local atomic environments, allowing a simple neural network to reach the accuracy required for the problem of study at a negligible additional cost. The balance between accuracy and efficiency is determined by the baseline simulation. This is shown in results where high level quantum chemical accuracy is obtained for simulations of liquid water at standard DFT cost, or where high level DFT-accuracy is achieved in simulations with a low-level baseline DFT calculation, at a significantly reduced cost.},

  abstract = {Atomistic machine learning (AML) simulations are used in chemistry at an ever-increasing pace. A large number of AML models has been developed, but their implementations are scattered among different packages, each with its own conventions for input and output. Thus, here we give an overview of our MLatom 2 software package, which provides an integrative platform for a wide variety of AML simulations by implementing from scratch and interfacing existing software for a range of state-of-the-art models. These include kernel method-based model types such as KREG (native implementation), sGDML, and GAP-SOAP as well as neural-network-based model types such as ANI, DeepPot-SE, and PhysNet. The theoretical foundations behind these methods are overviewed too. The modular structure of MLatom allows for easy extension to more AML model types. MLatom 2 also has many other capabilities useful for AML simulations, such as the support of custom descriptors, farthest-point and structure-based sampling, hyperparameter optimization, model evaluation, and automatic learning curve generation. It can also be used for such multi-step tasks as Delta-learning, self-correction approaches, and absorption spectrum simulation within the machine-learning nuclear-ensemble approach. Several of these MLatom 2 capabilities are showcased in application examples.},

  abstract = {High-throughput computational screening typically employs methods (i.e., density functional theory or DFT) that can fail to describe challenging molecules, such as those with strongly correlated electronic structure. In such cases, multireference (MR) correlated wavefunction theory (WFT) would be the appropriate choice but remains more challenging to carry out and automate than single-reference (SR) WFT or DFT. Numerous diagnostics have been proposed for identifying when MR character is likely to have an effect on the predictive power of SR calculations, but conflicting conclusions about diagnostic performance have been reached on small data sets. We compute 15 MR diagnostics, ranging from affordable DFT-based to more costly MR-WFT-based diagnostics, on a set of 3165 equilibrium and distorted small organic molecules containing up to six heavy atoms. Conflicting MR character assignments and low pairwise linear correlations among diagnostics are also observed over this set. We evaluate the ability of existing diagnostics to predict the percent recovery of the correlation energy, \%E-corr. None of the DFT-based diagnostics are nearly as predictive of \%E-corr as the best WFT-based diagnostics. To overcome the limitation of this cost-accuracy trade-off, we develop machine learning (ML, i.e., kernel ridge regression) models to predict WFT-based diagnostics from a combination of DFT-based diagnostics and a new, size-independent 3D geometric representation. The ML-predicted diagnostics correlate as well with MR effects as their computed (i.e., with WFT) values, significantly improving over the DFT-based diagnostics on which the models were trained. These ML models thus provide a promising approach to improve upon DFT-based diagnostic accuracy while remaining suitably low cost for high-throughput screening.},

  abstract = {High-throughput computational screening for chemical discovery mandates the automated and unsupervised simulation of thousands of new molecules and materials. In challenging materials spaces, such as open shell transition metal chemistry, characterization requires time-consuming first-principles simulation that often necessitates human intervention. These calculations can frequently lead to a null result, e.g., the calculation does not converge or the molecule does not stay intact during a geometry optimization. To overcome this challenge toward realizing fully automated chemical discovery in transition metal chemistry, we have developed the first machine learning models that predict the likelihood of successful simulation outcomes. We train support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers to predict simulation outcomes (i.e., geometry optimization result and degree of {$<$} S-2 {$>$} deviation) for a chosen electronic structure method based on chemical composition. For these static models, we achieve an area under the curve of at least 0.95, minimizing computational time spent on nonproductive simulations and therefore enabling efficient chemical space exploration. We introduce a metric of model uncertainty based on the distribution of points in the latent space to systematically improve model prediction confidence. In a complementary approach, we train a convolutional neural network classification model on simulation output electronic and geometric structure time series data. This dynamic model generalizes more readily than the static classifier by becoming more predictive as input simulation length increases. Finally, we describe approaches for using these models to enable autonomous job control in transition metal complex discovery.},

Examples of nanoporous materials are zeolites, carbon nanotubes, clays, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). The molecular confinement these materials offer has been exploited in adsorption and catalysis for almost 50 years. Molecular simulations have provided understanding of the underlying shape selectivity, and adsorption and diffusion effects. Much of the reliability of the modeling predictions depends on the accuracy and transferability of the force field. However, flexibility and the chemical and structural diversity of MOFs add significant challenges for engineering force fields that are able to reproduce experimentally observed structural and dynamic properties. Recent developments in design, parameterization, and implementation of force fields for MOFs and zeolites are reviewed.},

They are potentially free of the curse of dimensionality for many different applications and have been proven to be so in the case of some nonlinear Monte Carlo methods for nonlinear parabolic PDEs. In this paper, we review these numerical and theoretical advances. In addition to algorithms based on stochastic reformulations of the original problem, such as the multilevel Picard iteration and the Deep BSDE method, we also discuss algorithms based on the more traditional Ritz, Galerkin, and least square formulations. We hope to demonstrate to the reader that studying PDEs as well as control and variational problems in very high dimensions might very well be among the most promising new directions in mathematics and scientific computing in the near future.},

This process is thought to occur within the bulk of an aerosol, through solvation and subsequent hydrolysis. However, this perspective is difficult to reconcile with field measurements and cannot be verified directly because of the fast reaction kinetics of N 2 O 5. Here, we use molecular simulations, including reactive potentials and importance sampling, to study the uptake of N 2 O 5 into an aqueous aerosol. Rather than being mediated by the bulk, uptake is dominated by interfacial processes due to facile hydrolysis at the liquid-vapor interface and competitive reevaporation. With this molecular information, we propose an alternative interfacial reactive uptake model consistent with existing experimental observations.},

We dissect the emerging approaches using deep learning techniques for protein structural modeling and discuss advances and challenges that must be addressed. We argue for the central importance of structure, following the "sequence/structure/function'' paradigm.

  abstract = {Coulomb interactions play a major role in determining the thermodynamics, structure, and dynamics of condensed-phase systems, but often present significant challenges. Computer simulations usually use periodic boundary conditions to minimize corrections from finite cell boundaries but the long range of the Coulomb interactions generates significant contributions from distant periodic images of the simulation cell, usually calculated by Ewald sum techniques. This can add significant overhead to computer simulations and hampers the development of intuitive local pictures and simple analytic theory. In this paper, we present a general framework based on local molecular field theory to accurately determine the contributions from long-ranged Coulomb interactions to the potential of mean force between ionic or apolar hydrophobic solutes in dilute aqueous solutions described by standard classical point charge water models. The simplest approximation leads to a short solvent (SS) model, with truncated solvent-solvent and solute-solvent Coulomb interactions and long-ranged but screened Coulomb interactions only between charged solutes. The SS model accurately describes the interplay between strong short-ranged solute core interactions, local hydrogen-bond configurations, and long-ranged dielectric screening of distant charges, competing effects that are difficult to capture in standard implicit solvent models.},

Here, we address the methodological question of how one can fit GAP models that accurately predict vibrational properties in specific regions of configuration space while retaining flexibility and transferability to others. We use an adaptive regularization of the GAP fit that scales with the absolute force magnitude on any given atom, thereby exploring the Bayesian interpretation of GAP regularization as an "expected error" and its impact on the prediction of physical properties for a material of interest. The approach enables excellent predictions of phonon modes (to within 0.1 THz-0.2 THz) for structurally diverse silicon allotropes, and it can be coupled with existing fitting databases for high transferability across different regions of configuration space, which we demonstrate for liquid and amorphous silicon. These findings and workflows are expected to be useful for GAP-driven materials modeling more generally.},

The proliferation of approaches, as well as the fact that each choice of features can lead to very different behavior depending on how they are used, e.g. by introducing non-linear kernels and non-Euclidean metrics to manipulate them, makes it difficult to objectively compare different methods, and to address fundamental questions on how one feature space is related to another. In this work we introduce a framework to compare different sets of descriptors, and different ways of transforming them by means of metrics and kernels, in terms of the structure of the feature space that they induce. We define diagnostic tools to determine whether alternative feature spaces contain equivalent amounts of information, and whether the common information is substantially distorted when going from one feature space to another. We compare, in particular, representations that are built in terms of n-body correlations of the atom density, quantitatively assessing the information loss associated with the use of low-order features. We also investigate the impact of different choices of basis functions and hyperparameters of the widely used SOAP and Behler-Parrinello features, and investigate how the use of non-linear kernels, and of a Wasserstein-type metric, change the structure of the feature space in comparison to a simpler linear feature space.},

The description of such heterogeneous components requires the development and deployment of first principles methods, coupled to appropriate dynamical descriptions of matter and advanced sampling techniques, in order to capture all the relevant length and time scales of importance to the materials' performance. It is thus essential to build simple, streamlined computational schemes for the prediction and design of multiple properties of broad classes of materials, by developing interoperable codes which can be efficiently coupled to each other to perform complex tasks.

  abstract = {The most successful and popular machine learning models of atomic-scale properties derive their transferability from a locality ansatz. The properties of a large molecule or a bulk material are written as a sum over contributions that depend on the configurations within finite atom-centered environments. The obvious downside of this approach is that it cannot capture nonlocal, nonadditive effects such as those arising due to long-range electrostatics or quantum interference. We propose a solution to this problem by introducing nonlocal representations of the system, which are remapped as feature vectors that are defined locally and are equivariant in O(3). We consider, in particular, one form that has the same asymptotic behavior as the electrostatic potential. We demonstrate that this framework can capture nonlocal, long-range physics by building a model for the electrostatic energy of randomly distributed point-charges, for the unrelaxed binding curves of charged organic molecular dimers, and for the electronic dielectric response of liquid water. By combining a representation of the system that is sensitive to long-range correlations with the transferability of an atom-centered additive model, this method outperforms current state-of-the-art machine-learning schemes and provides a conceptual framework to incorporate nonlocal physics into atomistic machine learning.

  abstract = {Electronic nearsightedness is one of the fundamental principles that governs the behavior of condensed matter and supports its description in terms of local entities such as chemical bonds. Locality also underlies the tremendous success of machine-learning schemes that predict quantum mechanical observables - such as the cohesive energy, the electron density, or a variety of response properties - as a sum of atom-centred contributions, based on a short-range representation of atomic environments. One of the main shortcomings of these approaches is their inability to capture physical effects ranging from electrostatic interactions to quantum delocalization, which have a long-range nature. Here we show how to build a multi-scale scheme that combines in the same framework local and non-local information, overcoming such limitations. We show that the simplest version of such features can be put in formal correspondence with a multipole expansion of permanent electrostatics. The data-driven nature of the model construction, however, makes this simple form suitable to tackle also different types of delocalized and collective effects. We present several examples that range from molecular physics to surface science and biophysics, demonstrating the ability of this multi-scale approach to model interactions driven by electrostatics, polarization and dispersion, as well as the cooperative behavior of dielectric response functions.},

To overcome these limitations, we take inspiration from organic chemistry where full enumeration of neutral, closed-shell molecules under the constraint of size has enriched discovery efforts. We design monodentate and bidentate ligands from scratch for the construction of mononuclear, octahedral transition metal complexes with up to 13 heavy atoms (i.e., metal, C, N, O, P, or S). From {$>$}11 000 theoretical ligands, we develop a heuristic score for ranking a chemically feasible 2500 ligand subset, only 71 of which were previously included in common organic molecule databases. We characterize the top 20\% of scored ligands with density functional theory (DFT) in an octahedral homoleptic ligand database (OHLDB). The OHLDB contains i) the geometry optimized structures of 1250 homoleptic octahedral complexes obtained from the enumerated pool of ligands and an open-shell transition metal (M(ii)/M(iii), M = Cr, Mn, Fe, or Co) and ii) the resulting high-spin/low-spin adiabatic electronic energy differences (Delta EH-L) obtained with hybrid DFT. Over the OHLDB, we observe structure-property (i.e., Delta EH-L) relationships different from those expected on the basis of ligand field arguments or from our prior data sets. Finally, we demonstrate how incorporating OHLDB data into artificial neural network (ANN) training improves ANN out-of-sample performance on much larger transition metal complexes.},

  abstract = {In recent years, some arguments about the existence of medium-range order (MRO) in the Zr-Rh system have been put forward. However, research on the structural features of the Zr-Rh binary alloy at the atomic level is still lacking. This study uses ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to systematically study the local structures of Zr77Rh23 from the liquid to the glassy states. Pair correlation function (PCF), coordination number (CN), Honeycutt-Anderson(HA) index, bond-angle distribution functions, and the Voronoi tessellation method are used to reveal a clear icosahedral-like configuration in the amorphous Zr77Rh23 alloy. It is noteworthy that the splitting in the second peak of the partial PDF implies the existence of a medium range order (MRO) in the Zr77Rh23 system. We obtain the local order in three-dimensional atomic density distributions by using a new atomistic cluster alignment (ACA) method. Interestingly, a Bergman-type MRO is observed in the glassy Zr77Rh23. Furthermore, the spatial distribution and connections of icosahedral-like clusters are shown to further demonstrate the MRO network. Our findings shed light on the nature of atomic local structures of amorphous Zr77Rh23 alloy and have important implications to understanding the formation of various MROs in metallic glasses.

Using the quotient graph, we predict the new structure based on the feature of the experimental structure. Facing many structures generated by the quotient graph and reducing computation cost, the deep learning potential is used to optimize the structure. Through the electronic fitness function, it is found that the new structure with space group no. 64 shows a good electrical property of p-type and n-type. Based on the new structure, the n-type and p-type thermoelectric properties are studied by First-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory. The mechanical stability and thermodynamic stability of the new structure are checked, indicating that the new structure is stable. Due to the cyclic structure, the new structure shows large values of bulk modulus (B~\textasciitilde ~62.82~GPa), shear modulus (G~\textasciitilde ~43.78~GPa), Young’s modulus (E~\textasciitilde ~106.59~GPa), Debye temperature (θ~=~291 K), sound velocity (Va \textasciitilde 2890~m/s), and low value of Gruneisen parameter γ \textasciitilde 2.2, implying that strong Sn–Se atomic interactions and large lattice thermal conductivity. At 800 K, the figure of merit of p-type (1.83) is superior to that of n-type (1.68). The main scattering process of both charge transport and thermal transport is dominated by optical phonon~branches. This work not only demonstrates the excellent property of the new structure~but also provides insights to understand the transport performance of the cyclic structure.},

  abstract = {Module for ab initio structure evolution (MAISE) is an open-source package for materials modeling and prediction. The code's main feature is an automated generation of neural network (NN) interatomic potentials for use in global structure searches. The systematic construction of Behler-Parrinello-type NN models approximating ab initio energy and forces relies on two approaches introduced in our recent studies. An evolutionary sampling scheme for generating reference structures improves the NNs' mapping of regions visited in unconstrained searches, while a stratified training approach enables the creation of standardized NN models for multiple elements. A more flexible NN architecture proposed here expands the applicability of the stratified scheme for an arbitrary number of elements. The full workflow in the NN development is managed with a customizable 'MAISE-NET' wrapper written in Python. The global structure optimization capability in MAISE is based on an evolutionary algorithm applicable for nanopar-ticles, films, and bulk crystals. A multitribe extension of the algorithm allows for an efficient simultaneous optimization of nanoparticles in a given size range. Implemented structure analysis functions include fingerprinting with radial distribution functions and finding space groups with the SPGLIB tool. This work overviews MAISE's available features, constructed models, and confirmed predictions.},

We train the diabatic Hamiltonian elements and their analytical gradients with the SchNet architecture to construct machine learning models, while the phase freedom of off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian is cured by introducing the phase-less loss function. Our machine learning models show reasonable accuracy with mean absolute errors of similar to 0.1 kcal/mol and similar to 0.5 kcal/mol/A for the diabatic Hamiltonian elements and their gradients, respectively, for penta-2,4-dieniminium cation. Moreover, by exploiting the diabatic representation, our models can predict correct conical intersection structures and their topologies. In addition, our ML-ESMD simulations give almost identical result with a direct dynamics at the same level of theory.},

Various systems have been tested and the transferability across basis sets, structures, and nuclear configurations has been evaluated. Only a small number of molecules at the equilibrium structure has been needed for the training, and generally less than 5\% relative error has been achieved for structures outside the training domain and systems containing about 140 atoms. In addition, this approach has been applied to make predictions on correlation energies of nuclear configurations extracted from density functional theory-based molecular dynamics trajectories with only one or two structures as training data.},

In order to alleviate that situation, a trajectory-based machine learning (TrajML) approach is introduced for the construction of force fields by learning from AIMD trajectories. Only nuclear trajectories are required, which can be obtained by other methods beyond AIMD as well. We developed an easy-to-use MD machine learning package (TrajML MD) for instant modelling of the force field and system-focussed prediction of molecular configurations for MD trajectories. It consumes similar computational resources as classical MD but can simulate complex systems with a higher accuracy due to the targeted learning on the system of interest.},

Hydrodynamic approximation to the kinetic equation is used as an example to illustrate the main steps and issues involved. To this end, a set of generalized moments are constructed first to optimally represent the underlying velocity distribution. The well-known closure problem is then solved with the aim of best capturing the associated dynamics of the kinetic equation. The issue of physical constraints such as Galilean invariance is addressed and an active-learning procedure is introduced to help ensure that the dataset used is representative enough. The reduced system takes the form of a conventional moment system and works regardless of the numerical discretization used. Numerical results are presented for the BGK (Bhatnagar-GrossKrook) model and binary collision of Maxwell molecules. We demonstrate that the reduced model achieves a uniform accuracy in a wide range of Knudsen numbers spanning from the hydrodynamic limit to free molecular flow.},

  abstract = {Metal oxide/water interfaces play a crucial role in many electrochemical and photocatalytic processes, such as photoelectrochemical water splitting, the creation of fuel from sunlight, and electrochemical CO2 reduction. First-principles electronic structure calculations can reveal unique insights into these processes, such as the role of the alignment of the oxide electronic energy levels with those of liquid water. An essential prerequisite for the success of such calculations is the ability to predict accurate structural models of these interfaces, which in turn requires careful experimental validation. Here we report a general, quantitative validation protocol for first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of oxide/aqueous interfaces. The approach makes direct comparisons of interfacial x-ray reflectivity (XR) signals from experimental measurements and those obtained from ab initio simulations with semilocal and van der Waals functionals. The protocol is demonstrated here for the case of the Al2O3(001)/water interface, one of the simplest oxide/water interfaces. We discuss the technical requirements needed for validation, including the choice of the density functional, the simulation cell size, and the optimal choice of the thermodynamic ensemble. Our results establish a general paradigm for the validation of structural models and interactions at solid/water interfaces derived from first-principles simulations. While there is qualitative agreement between the simulated structures and the experimental best-fit structure, direct comparisons of simulated and measured XR intensities show quantitative discrepancies that derive from both bulk regions (i.e., alumina and water) as well as the interfacial region, highlighting the need for accurate density functionals to properly describe interfacial interactions. Our results show that XR data are sensitive not only to the atomic structure (i.e., the atom locations) but also to the electron-density distributions in both the substrate and at the interface.},

Unfortunately, accurate analysis of the underlying data can be difficult, even for domain experts, complicating the training of the models intended to drive experiments. This is especially true when the goal is to identify the presence of weak signatures in diffraction or spectroscopic datasets. In this work, we examine a set of as-obtained diffraction data that track the phase transition from monoclinic to tetragonal in a Nb-doped VO2 film as a function of temperature and dopant concentration. We then task a set of domain experts and a set of machine learning experts with identifying which phase is present in each diffraction pattern manually and algorithmically, respectively; in both cases, the labels can vary dramatically, especially at the phase boundaries. We use the mode of the labels and the Shannon entropy as a method to capture, preserve and propagate consensus labels and their variance. Further we use the expert labels as a benchmark and demonstrate the use of Shannon entropy weighted scoring to test the performance of machine learning generated labels. Finally, we propose a material data challenge centered around generating improved labeling algorithms. This real-world dataset curated with expert labels can act as test bed for new algorithms.

  abstract = {The length and time scales of atomistic simulations are limited by the computational cost of the methods used to predict material properties. In recent years there has been great progress in the use of machine-learning algorithms to develop fast and accurate interatomic potential models, but it remains a challenge to develop models that generalize well and are fast enough to be used at extreme time and length scales. To address this challenge, we have developed a machine-learning algorithm based on symbolic regression in the form of genetic programming that is capable of discovering accurate, computationally efficient many-body potential models. The key to our approach is to explore a hypothesis space of models based on fundamental physical principles and select models within this hypothesis space based on their accuracy, speed, and simplicity. The focus on simplicity reduces the risk of overfitting the training data and increases the chances of discovering a model that generalizes well. Our algorithm was validated by rediscovering an exact Lennard-Jones potential and a Sutton-Chen embedded-atom method potential from training data generated using these models. By using training data generated from density functional theory calculations, we found potential models for elemental copper that are simple, as fast as embedded-atom models, and capable of accurately predicting properties outside of their training set. Our approach requires relatively small sets of training data, making it possible to generate training data using highly accurate methods at a reasonable computational cost. We present our approach, the forms of the discovered models, and assessments of their transferability, accuracy and speed.},

One of the most important aspects of machine learning techniques is representation through the feature vector, which should contain the most important descriptors necessary to make accurate predictions, not least of which is the atomic species in the molecule or material. In this work we introduce a compressed representation of physical properties for atomic species we call the elemental modes. The elemental modes provide an excellent representation by capturing many of the nuances of the periodic table and the similarity of atomic species. We apply the elemental modes to several different tasks for machine learning algorithms and show that they enable us to make improvements to these tasks even beyond simply achieving higher accuracy predictions.},

  abstract = {We define a vector quantity which corresponds to atomic species identity by compressing a set of physical properties with an autoencoder. This vector, referred to here as the elemental modes, provides many advantages in downstream machine learning tasks. Using the elemental modes directly as the feature vector, we trained a neural network to predict formation energies of elpasolites with improved accuracy over previous works on the same task. Combining the elemental modes with geometric features used in high-dimensional neural network potentials (HD-NNPs) solves many problems of scaling and efficiency in the development of such neural network potentials. Whereas similar models in the past have been limited to typically four atomic species (H, C, N, and O), our implementation does not scale in cost by adding more atomic species and allows us to train an HD-NNP model which treats molecules containing H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Se, Br, and I. Finally, we establish that our implementation allows us to define feature vectors for alchemical intermediate states in the HD-NNP model, which opens up new possibilities for performing alchemical free energy calculations on systems where bond breaking/forming is important.

  abstract = {and a.shapeev@skoltech.ru Abstract A well-known drawback of state-of-the-art machine-learning interatomic potentials is their poor ability to extrapolate beyond the training domain. For small-scale problems with tens to hundreds of atoms this can be solved by using active learning which is able to select atomic configurations on which a potential attempts extrapolation and add them to the ab initio-computed training set. In this sense an active learning algorithm can be viewed as an on-the-fly interpolation of an ab initio model. For large-scale problems, possibly involving tens of thousands of atoms, this is not feasible because one cannot afford even a single density functional theory (DFT) computation with such a large number of atoms. This work marks a new milestone toward fully automatic ab initio-accurate large-scale atomistic simulations. We develop an active learning algorithm that identifies local subregions of the simulation region where the potential extrapolates. Then the algorithm constructs periodic configurations out of these local, non-periodic subregions, sufficiently small to be computable with plane-wave DFT codes, in order to obtain accurate ab initio energies. We benchmark our algorithm on the problem of screw dislocation motion in bcc tungsten and show that our algorithm reaches ab initio accuracy, down to typical magnitudes of numerical noise in DFT codes. We show that our algorithm reproduces material properties such as core structure, Peierls barrier, and Peierls stress. This unleashes new capabilities for computational materials science toward applications which have currently been out of scope if approached solely by ab initio methods.},

  abstract = {We present an automated procedure for computing stacking fault energies in random alloys from large-scale simulations using moment tensor potentials (MTPs) with the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). To that end, we develop an algorithm for training MTPs on random alloys. In the first step, our algorithm constructs a set of \textasciitilde 10000 or more training candidate configurations with 50-100 atoms that are representative for the atomic neighborhoods occurring in the large-scale simulation. In the second step, we use active learning to reduce this set to \textasciitilde 100 most distinct configurations - for which DFT energies and forces are computed and on which the potential is ultimately trained. We validate our algorithm for the MoNbTa medium-entropy alloy by showing that the MTP reproduces the DFT \$\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{4\}[111]\$ unstable stacking fault energy over the entire compositional space up to a few percent. Contrary to state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the coherent potential approximation (CPA) or special quasi-random structures (SQSs), our algorithm naturally accounts for relaxation, is not limited by DFT cell sizes, and opens opportunities to efficiently investigate follow-up problems, such as chemical ordering. In a broader sense, our algorithm can be easily modified to compute related properties of random alloys, for instance, misfit volumes, or grain boundary energies. Moreover, it forms the basis for an efficient construction of MTPs to be used in large-scale simulations of multicomponent systems.},

  abstract = {A huge amount of water at supercritical conditions exists in Earth's interior, where its dielectric properties play a critical role in determining how it stores and transports materials. However, it is very challenging to obtain the static dielectric constant of water, E-0, in a wide pressure-temperature (P-T) range as found in deep Earth either experimentally or by first-principles simulations. Here, we introduce a neural network dipole model, which, combined with molecular dynamics, can be used to compute P-T dependent dielectric properties of water as accurately as first-principles methods but much more efficiently. We found that E-0 may vary by one order of magnitude in Earth's upper mantle, suggesting that the solvation properties of water change dramatically at different depths. Although E-0 and the molecular dipole moment increase with an increase in pressure along an isotherm, the dipolar angular correlation has its maximum at 5 GPa-7 GPa, which may indicate that hydrogen bonds become weaker at high pressure. We also calculated the frequency-dependent dielectric constant of water in the microwave range, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been calculated from first principles, and found that temperature affects the dielectric absorption more than pressure. Our results are of great use in many areas, e.g., modeling water-rock interactions in geochemistry. The computational approach introduced here can be readily applied to other molecular fluids.},

The first principles based virtual sampling of this space, for example in search of novel molecules or materials which exhibit desirable properties, is therefore prohibitive for all but the smallest sub-sets and simplest properties. We review studies aimed at tackling this challenge using modern machine learning techniques based on (i) synthetic data, typically generated using quantum mechanics based methods, and (ii) model architectures inspired by quantum mechanics. Such Quantum mechanics based Machine Learning (QML) approaches combine the numerical efficiency of statistical surrogate models with an \{\textbackslash em ab initio\} view on matter. They rigorously reflect the underlying physics in order to reach universality and transferability across CCS. While state-of-the-art approximations to quantum problems impose severe computational bottlenecks, recent QML based developments indicate the possibility of substantial acceleration without sacrificing the predictive power of quantum mechanics.},

In the second phase, a solution ansatz of the finite element method to solve the given PDE is obtained from the approximate solution in the first phase, and the ansatz can serve as a good initial guess such that Newton’s method or other iterative methods for solving the nonlinear PDE are able to converge to the ground truth solution with high-accuracy quickly. Systematic theoretical analysis is provided to justify the Int-Deep framework for several classes of problems. Numerical results show that the Int-Deep outperforms existing purely deep learning-based methods or traditional iterative methods (e.g., Newton’s method and the Picard iteration method).},

  abstract = {Phonon-mediated thermal transport is inherently multi-scale. The wave-length of phonons (considering phonons as waves) is typically at the nanometer scale; the typical size of a phonon wave energy packet is tens of nanometers, while the phonon mean free path (MFP) can be as long as microns. At different length scales, the phonons will interact with structures of different feature sizes, which can be as small as 0D defects (point defects), short to medium range linear defects (dislocations), medium to large range 2D planar defects (stacking faults and twin boundaries), and large scale 3D defects (voids, inclusions, and various microstructures). The nature of multi-scale thermal transport is that there are different heat transfer physics across different length scales and in the meantime the physics crossing the different scales is interdependent and coupled. Since phonon behavior is usually mode dependent, thermal transport in materials with a combined micro-/nano-structure complexity becomes complicated, making modeling this kind of transport process very challenging. In this perspective, we first summarize the advantages and disadvantages of computational methods for mono-scale heat transfer and the state-of-the-art multi-scale thermal transport modeling. We then discuss a few important aspects of the future development of multi-scale modeling, in particular with the aid of modern machine learning and uncertainty quantification techniques. As more sophisticated theoretical and computational methods continue to advance thermal transport predictions, novel heat transfer physics and thermally functional materials will be discovered for the pertaining energy systems and technologies.},

However, a coarse graining model must be formulated such that the conclusions we draw from it are consistent with the conclusions we would draw from a model at a finer level of detail. It has been proved that a force matching scheme defines a thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained model for an atomistic system in the variational limit. Wang et al. [ACS Cent. Sci. 5, 755 (2019)] demonstrated that the existence of such a variational limit enables the use of a supervised machine learning framework to generate a coarse-grained force field, which can then be used for simulation in the coarse-grained space. Their framework, however, requires the manual input of molecular features to machine learn the force field. In the present contribution, we build upon the advance of Wang et al. and introduce a hybrid architecture for the machine learning of coarse-grained force fields that learn their own features via a subnetwork that leverages continuous filter convolutions on a graph neural network architecture. We demonstrate that this framework succeeds at reproducing the thermodynamics for small biomolecular systems. Since the learned molecular representations are inherently transferable, the architecture presented here sets the stage for the development of machine-learned, coarse-grained force fields that are transferable across molecular systems.},

  abstract = {Conjugated polymers represent a high-potential material class due to the tunability of their optoelectronic properties via straightforward processing protocols. However, to in silico tailor these optoelectronic properties, one must compute the conformationally dependent electronic structure over mesoscopic length and time scales. This task represents a challenging multiscale computational problem in which quantum chemistry and atomistic or coarse-grained molecular dynamics must be integrated. Recently, we introduced a methodology, called electronic coarse graining (ECG), that utilizes artificial neural networks to compute ab initio quality electronic structures using only the reduced degrees of freedom of coarse-grained models. Here, we adapt ECG to variable-molecular weight conjugated oligomers by casting the problem in the framework of sequence detection. A machine-learning (ML) architecture employing one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks is utilized to compute ground-state orbital energies, charge density distributions, and optical spectra solely from the coarse-grained model's configurational degrees of freedom. Robust molecular weight transferability for ECG is established via a A-ML approach that leverages model electronic Hamiltonians for ground and excited-state property determination. The accuracy and transferability of the ECG methodology opens the door for scalable optoelectronic property prediction in conjugated polymers directly from coarse-grained degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {Computational studies aimed at understanding conformationally dependent electronic structure in soft materials require a combination of classical and quantum-mechanical simulations, for which the sampling of conformational space can be particularly demanding. Coarse-grained (CG) models provide a means of accessing relevant time scales, but CG configurations must be back-mapped into atomistic representations to perform quantum-chemical calculations, which is computationally intensive and inconsistent with the spatial resolution of the CG models. A machine learning approach, denoted as artificial neural network electronic coarse graining (ANN-ECG), is presented here in which the conformationally dependent electronic structure of a molecule is mapped directly to CG pseudo-atom configurations. By averaging over decimated degrees of freedom, ANN-ECG accelerates simulations by eliminating backmapping and repeated quantum-chemical calculations. The approach is accurate, consistent with the CG spatial resolution, and can be used to identify computationally optimal CG resolutions.},

The recent emergence of machine-learning (ML) and modern optimization algorithms has accelerated material property prediction, as well as stimulated the development of hybrid ML/molecular modeling methodologies capable of providing physical insights unobtainable from purely physics-based modeling and intuition. Such hybrid techniques also have important ramifications for the ML-enhanced interpretation of results from simulations and experiments alike. Leveraging ML techniques for the design of chemical or morphological structures based on a target property or functionality represents an exciting goal for the general area of soft materials, including polymers, liquid crystals, colloids, or biomolecules, to name a few representative classes of systems.

Alloy mechanical properties are then controlled by atomic scale phenomena such as shearing of the precipitates by dislocations. Atomistic modeling to understand the operative mechanisms requires length and timescales far larger than those accessible by first-principles methods. Here, a family of Behler-Parinello neural network potentials (NNPs) for the Al-Mg-Si system is developed to enable quantitative studies of Al-6xxx alloys. The NNP is trained on metallurgically important quantities computed by first-principles density function theory (DFT) leading to high-fidelity predictions of intermetallic compounds, elastic constants, dilute solid-solution energetics, precipitate/matrix interfaces, Al stacking fault energies, antisite defect energies, and other quantities. The generalized stacking fault energy surfaces for the three prevalent β′′ precipitate compositions in peak-aged Al-6xxx are then computed with the NNP, and are validated by DFT computations at key points. A preliminary examination of early stage clustering kinetics and energetics in Al-6xxx is then made, showing the formation of low-energy Mg-Si structures and the trapping of vacancies in these clusters. The NNP thus shows significant transferability across structures, making it a powerful approach for chemically accurate simulations of metallurgical phenomena in Al-Mg-Si alloys.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric aerosol nucleation contributes to around half of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) globally and the nucleated particles can grow larger to impact air quality and consequently human health. Despite the decades' efforts, the detailed nucleation mechanism is still poorly understood. The ultimate goal of theoretical understanding aerosol nucleation is to simulate nucleation in ambient condition. However, there is lack of accurate reactive force field. Here for the first time, we propose the reactive force field with good size scalability for nucleation systems based on deep neural network and further bridge the simulation in the limited box with cluster kinetics towards boosting the aerosol simulation to be fully ab initio. We found that the formation rates based on hard sphere collision rate constants tend to be underestimated. Besides, the framework here is transferable to other nucleation systems, potentially revolutionizing the atmospheric aerosol nucleation field. Theoretical understanding of nucleation mechanism largely relies on classical nucleation theory (CNT) 1 which give a general mind map for nucleation thermodynamics and kinetics 2 even though the capillary assumption is extensively criticized 3. The emergence and then broadly employed theoretical model in the past decade, Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) 4 , surmounts the drawbacks of CNT through coupled quantum chemical thermodynamics 5 with the birth-death equations 2. Within the model, collision rate constants and evaporation rates are the two most critical parameters, determining the accuracy to predict macro parameters like cluster concentrations and formation rates which can be directly compared with experiments 6. Evaporation rates, derived from detailed balance and ab initio thermodynamics can be very accurate with sophisticated theoretical calculations 7. However, collision rate constants, derived from simple hard sphere model, is still very rough, far from the ab initio based evaporation rate. Here we propose a general framework to potentially boost the aerosol nucleation simulation toward fully ab initio. In the framework, deep neural network based force field (DNN-FF) is trained that can perform robust nucleation molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to derive the collision rate constants. Then static quantum chemical thermodynamics based evaporation rates are coupled into cluster dynamics model to provide ab initio kinetics for atmospheric aerosol nucleation.},

This has been particularly challenging for multi-component alloy systems due to the complex and non-linear nature of the associated PES. In this work, we develop an accurate PES model for the Al-Cu-Mg system by employing deep potential (DP), a neural network based representation of the PES, and DP generator (DP-GEN), a concurrent-learning scheme that generates a compact set of ab initio data for training. The resulting DP model gives predictions consistent with first-principles calculations for various binary and ternary systems on their fundamental energetic and mechanical properties, including formation energy, equilibrium volume, equation of state, interstitial energy, vacancy and surface formation energy, as well as elastic moduli. Extensive benchmark shows that the DP model is ready and will be useful for atomistic modeling of the Al-Cu-Mg system within the full range of concentration.},

Owing to the intrinsic limitations of even the most advanced experimental and computational techniques, a mechanistic understanding of Li deposition (growth) on the atomic scale is lacking. Here, we construct a Li potential model by machine learning with an accuracy of quantum mechanical computations. Our molecular dynamics simulations based on this potential model reveal two self-healing mechanisms in a large Li metal system, surface self-healing and bulk self-healing, and identify three Li dendrite morphologies in different conditions, "needle," "mushroom," and "hemisphere." We finally propose the concepts of local current density and variance of local current density as a supplement to critical current density to determine the probability of self-healing triggered.},

The algorithms allow the machine to self-learn an interatomic potential and construct machine-learned models on the fly during simulations. State-of-the-art query strategies allow the machine to judge whether new structures are out of the training data set or not. Only when the machine judges the necessity of updating the data set with the new structures are first-principles calculations carried out. Otherwise, the yet available machine-learned model is used to update the atomic positions. In this manner, most of the first-principles calculations are bypassed during training, and overall, simulations are accelerated by several orders of magnitude while retaining almost first-principles accuracy. In this Perspective, after describing essential components of the active-learning algorithms, we demonstrate the power of the schemes by presenting recent applications.}

  abstract = {Atomic simulations based on quantum mechanics (QM) calculations have entered into the tool box of chemists over the past few decades, facilitating an understanding of a wide range of chemistry problems, from structure characterization to reactivity determination. Due to the poor scaling and high computational cost intrinsic to QM calculations, one has to either sacrifice accuracy or time when performing large-scale atomic simulations. The battle to find a better compromise between accuracy and speed has been central to the development of new theoretical methods. The recent advances of machine-learning (ML)-based large-scale atomic simulations has shown great promise to the benefit of many branches of chemistry. Instead of solving the Schrodinger equation directly, ML-based simulations rely on a large data set of accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) and complex numerical models to predict the total energy. These simulations feature both a high speed and a high accuracy for computing large systems. Due to the lack of a physical foundation in numerical models, ML models are often frustrated in their predictivity and robustness, which are key to applications. Focusing on these concerns, here we overview the recent advances in ML methodologies for atomic simulations on three key aspects. Namely, the generation of a representative data set, the extensity of ML models, and the continuity of data representation. While global optimization methods are the natural choice for building a representative data set, the stochastic surface walking method is shown to provide the desired PES sampling for both minima and transition regions on the PES. The current ML models generally utilize local geometrical descriptors as an input and consider the total energy as the sum of atomic energies. There are many flavors of data descriptors and ML models, but the applications for material and reaction predictions are still limited, not least because of the difficulty to train the associated vast global data sets. We show that our recently designed power-type structure descriptors together with a feed-forward neural network (NN) model are compatible with highly complex global PES data, which has led to a large family of global NN (G-NN) potentials. Two recent applications of G-NN potentials in material and reaction simulations are selected to illustrate how ML-based atomic simulations can help the discovery of new materials and reactions.},

  abstract = {First-principles determination of free energy profiles for condensed-phase chemical reactions is hampered by the daunting costs associated with configurational sampling on ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (AI/MM) potential energy surfaces. Here, we report a new method that enables efficient AI/MM free energy simulations through mean force fitting. In this method, a free energy path in collective variables (CVs) is first determined on an efficient reactive aiding potential. Based on the configurations sampled along the free energy path, correcting forces to reproduce the AI/MM forces on the CVs are determined through force matching. The AI/MM free energy profile is then predicted from simulations on the aiding potential in conjunction with the correcting forces. Such cycles of correction–prediction are repeated until convergence is established. As the instantaneous forces on the CVs sampled in equilibrium ensembles along the free energy path are fitted, this procedure faithfully restores the target free energy profile by reproducing the free energy mean forces. Due to its close connection with the reaction path-force matching (RP-FM) framework recently introduced by us, we designate the new method as RP-FM in collective variables (RP-FM-CV). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a type-II solution-phase SN2 reaction, NH3 + CH3Cl (the Menshutkin reaction), simulated with an explicit water solvent. To obtain the AI/MM free energy profiles, we employed the semiempirical AM1/MM Hamiltonian as the base level for determining the string minimum free energy pathway, along which the free energy mean forces are fitted to various target AI/MM levels using the Hartree–Fock (HF) theory, density functional theory (DFT), and the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory as the AI method. The forces on the bond-breaking and bond-forming CVs at both the base and target levels are obtained by force transformation from Cartesian to redundant internal coordinates under the Wilson B-matrix formalism, where the linearized FM is facilitated by the use of spline functions. For the Menshutkin reaction tested, our FM treatment greatly reduces the deviations on the CV forces, originally in the range of 12–33 to ∼2 kcal/mol/Å. Comparisons with the experimental and benchmark AI/MM results, tests of the new method under a variety of simulation protocols, and analyses of the solute–solvent radial distribution functions suggest that RP-FM-CV can be used as an efficient, accurate, and robust method for simulating solution-phase chemical reactions.},

  abstract = {By including a fraction of exact exchange (EXX), hybrid functionals reduce the self-interaction error in semilocal density functional theory (DFT) and thereby furnish a more accurate and reliable description of the underlying electronic structure in systems throughout biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science. However, the high computational cost associated with the evaluation of all required EXX quantities has limited the applicability of hybrid DFT in the treatment of large molecules and complex condensed-phase materials. To overcome this limitation, we describe a linear-scaling approach that utilizes a local representation of the occupied orbitals (e.g., maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs)) to exploit the sparsity in the real-space evaluation of the quantum mechanical exchange interaction in finite-gap systems. In this work, we present a detailed description of the theoretical and algorithmic advances required to perform MLWF-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of large-scale condensed-phase systems of interest at the hybrid DFT level. We focus our theoretical discussion on the integration of this approach into the framework of Car-Parrinello AIMD, and highlight the central role played by the MLWF-product potential (i.e., the solution of Poisson's equation for each corresponding MLWF-product density) in the evaluation of the EXX energy and wave function forces. We then provide a comprehensive description of the exx algorithm implemented in the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO program, which employs a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization scheme to efficiently utilize the high-performance computing (HPC) resources available on current- and next-generation supercomputer architectures. This is followed by a critical assessment of the accuracy and parallel performance (e.g., strong and weak scaling) of this approach when AIMD simulations of liquid water are performed in the canonical (NVT) ensemble. With access to HPC resources, we demonstrate that exx enables hybrid DFT-based AIMD simulations of condensed-phase systems containing 500-1000 atoms (e.g., (H2O)(256)) with a wall time cost that is comparable to that of semilocal DFT. In doing so, exx takes us one step closer to routinely performing AIMD simulations of complex and large-scale condensed-phase systems for sufficiently long time scales at the hybrid DFT level of theory.},

  abstract = {We introduce a generalized machine learning framework to probabilistically parameterize upper-scale models in the form of nonlinear PDEs consistent with a continuum theory, based on coarse-grained atomistic simulation data of mechanical deformation and flow processes. The proposed framework utilizes a hypothesized coarse-graining methodology with manifold learning and surrogate-based optimization techniques. Coarsegrained high-dimensional data describing quantities of interest of the multiscale models are projected onto a nonlinear manifold whose geometric and topological structure is exploited for measuring behavioral discrepancies in the form of manifold distances. A surrogate model is constructed using Gaussian process regression to identify a mapping between stochastic parameters and distances. Derivative-free optimization is employed to adaptively identify a unique set of parameters of the upper-scale model capable of rapidly reproducing the system’s behavior while maintaining consistency with coarse-grained atomic-level simulations. The proposed method is applied to learn the parameters of the shear transformation zone (STZ) theory of plasticity that describes plastic deformation in amorphous solids as well as coarse-graining parameters needed to translate between atomistic and continuum representations. We show that the methodology is able to successfully link coarse-grained microscale simulations to macroscale observables and achieve a high-level of parity between the models across scales.},

We compute the exact dielectric constant in canonical ensemble from NNQMD trajectories using fluctuations in macroscopic polarization computed from maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF). Two deep neural networks are constructed. The first, NNQMD, is trained on QMD configurations for liquid water under a variety of temperature and density conditions to learn potential energy surface and forces and then perform molecular dynamics simulations. The second network, NNMLWF, is trained to predict locations of MLWF of individual molecules using the atomic configurations from NNQMD. Training data for both the neural networks is produced using a highly accurate quantum-mechanical method, DFT-SCAN that yields an excellent description of liquid water. We produce 280 x 10(6) configurations of water at 7 temperatures using NNQMD and predict MLWF centers using NNMLWF to compute the polarization fluctuations. The length of trajectories needed for a converged value of the dielectric constant at 0 degrees C is found to be 20 ns (40 x 10(6) configurations with 0.5 fs time step). The computed dielectric constants for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees C are in good agreement with experiments.

Dumbbell polymer solutions are used as examples to demonstrate the essential ideas. To faithfully retain molecular fidelity, we establish a micro-macro correspondence via a set of encoders for the microscale polymer configurations and their macroscale counterparts, a set of nonlinear conformation tensors. The dynamics of these conformation tensors can be derived from the microscale model, and the relevant terms can be parametrized using machine learning. The final model, named the deep non-Newtonian model (DeePN2), takes the form of conventional non-Newtonian fluid dynamics models, with a generalized form of the objective tensor derivative that retains the microscale interpretations. Both the formulation of the dynamic equation and the neural network representation rigorously preserve the rotational invariance, which ensures the admissibility of the constructed model. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of DeePN2 where models based on empirical closures show limitations.}

  abstract = {Chemical reactions constitute the central feature of many liquid, material, and biomolecular processes. Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) is inadequate for simulating chemical reactions given the fixed bonding topology of most force fields, while modeling chemical reactions using ab initio molecular dynamics is limited to shorter time and length scales given its high computational cost. As such, the multiscale reactive molecular dynamics method provides one promising alternative for simulating complex chemical systems at atomistic detail on a reactive potential energy surface. However, the parameterization of such models is a key barrier to their applicability and success. In this work, we present reactive MD models derived from constrained density functional theory that are both accurate and transferable. We illustrate the features of these models for proton dissociation reactions of amino acids in both aqueous and protein environments. Specifically, we present models for ionizable glutamate and lysine that predict accurate absolute pKa values in water, as well as their significantly shifted pKa in staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) without any modification of the models. As one outcome of the new methodology, the simulations show that the deprotonation of ionizable residues in SNase can be closely coupled with sidechain rotations, which is a concept likely generalizable to many other proteins. Furthermore, the present approach is not limited to only pKa prediction, but can enable the fully atomistic simulation of many other reactive systems along with a determination of the key aspects of the reaction mechanisms.},

We choose a representative system phytochromobilin (P Phi B) chromophore model to illustrate the analysis protocol. After a large number of trajectories are obtained, it is possible to define the similarity of different trajectories by the Frechet distance and to employ the trajectory clustering analysis to divide all trajectories into several clusters. Each cluster in principle represents a photoinduced isomerization reaction channel. This idea provides an effective approach to understand the branching ratio of the multi-channel photoisomerization dynamics. For each cluster, the dimensionality reduction is employed to understand the configuration similarity in the trajectory propagation, which provides the understanding of the major geometry evolution features in each reaction channel. The results show that this analysis protocol not only assigns all trajectories into different photoisomerization reaction channels but also extracts the major molecular motion without the requirement of the pre-known knowledge of the active photoisomerization site. As a side product of this analysis tool, it is also easy to find the so-called "typical" or "representative" trajectory for each reaction channel. Published by AIP Publishing.},

  abstract = {Theoretical studies on the MgCl2-KCl eutectic heavily rely on ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). However, neither large-scale nor long-time calculations are feasible in the framework of the ab initio method, which makes it challenging to accurately predict some properties. To address this issue, a scheme based on ab initio calculation, deep neural networks, and machine learning is introduced. By training on high-quality data sets generated by ab initio calculations, a deep potential (DP) is constructed to describe the interaction between atoms. This work shows that the DP enables higher efficiency and similar accuracy relative to DFT. By performing molecular dynamics simulations with DP, the microstructure and thermophysical properties of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic (32:68 mol \%) are investigated. The structural evolution with temperature is analyzed through partial radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, angular distribution functions, and structural factors. Meanwhile, the estimated thermophysical properties are discussed, including density, thermal expansion coefficient, shear viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and specific heat capacity. It reveals that the Mg2+ ions in this system have a distorted tetrahedral geometry rather than an octahedral one (with vacancies). The microstructure of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic shows the feature of medium-range order, and this feature will be enhanced at a higher temperature. All predicted thermophysical properties are in good agreement with the experimental results. The hydrodynamic radius determined from the shear viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient shows that the Me ions have a strong local structure and diffuse as if with an intact coordination shell.

  abstract = {In previous work, molten magnesium chloride has been investigated using first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations based on density functional theory (DFT). However, such simulations are computationally intensive and therefore are restricted in terms of simulated size and time. In this work, a machine learning-based deep potential (DP) is trained to accelerate the molecular dynamics simulation of molten magnesium chloride. The trained DP can accurately describe the energies and forces with the prediction errors in energy and force being 1.76 x 10(-3) eV/atom and 4.76 x 10(-2) eV angstrom(-1), respectively. Applying the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) approach, simulations can be performed with more than 1000 atoms, which is infeasible for FPMD simulations. Additionally, the partial radial distribution functions, angle distribution functions, densities, and self-diffusion coefficients predicted by DPMD simulations are also in reasonable agreement with FPMD or experimental results. This work shows that the DP enables higher efficiency and similar accuracy relative to DFT, exhibiting a bright application prospect in modeling molten salt systems.},

Large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations were performed over a wider range of temperatures than AIMD to confirm the reliability and generality of the DPs. We demonstrated that the generated DPs can serve as a powerful tool for simulating alkali chlorides; the DPs also provide results with accuracy that is comparable to that of AIMD and efficiency that is similar to that of empirical potentials. The partial radial distribution functions and angle distribution functions predicted using the DPs are in close agreement with those derived from AIMD. The estimated densities, self-diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and electrical conductivities also matched well with the AIMD and experimental data. This work provides confidence that DPs can be used to explore other systems, including mixtures of chlorides or entirely different salts.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks with rectified linear units (ReLU) are getting more and more popular due to their universal representation power and successful applications. Some theoretical progress regarding the approximation power of deep ReLU network for functions in Sobolev space and Korobov space have recently been made by [D. Yarotsky, Neural Network, 94:103-114, 2017] and [H. Montanelli and Q. Du, SIAM J Math. Data Sci., 1:78-92, 2019], etc. In this paper, we show that deep networks with rectified power units (RePU) can give better approximations for smooth functions than deep ReLU networks. Our analysis bases on classical polynomial approximation theory and some efficient algorithms proposed in this paper to convert polynomials into deep RePU networks of optimal size with no approximation error. Comparing to the results on ReLU networks, the sizes of RePU networks required to approximate functions in Sobolev space and Korobov space with an error tolerance epsilon, by our constructive proofs, are in general O(log1/epsilon) times smaller than the sizes of corresponding ReLU networks constructed in most of the existing literature. Comparing to the classical results of Mhaskar [Mhaskar, Adv. Comput. Math. 1:61-80, 1993], our constructions use less number of activation functions and numerically more stable, they can be served as good initials of deep RePU networks and further trained to break the limit of linear approximation theory. The functions represented by RePU networks are smooth functions, so they naturally fit in the places where derivatives are involved in the loss function.},

However, efficient and accurate evaluation of salt properties from a fundamental, microscopic perspective remains a challenge. Here, we apply artificial neural networks to atomistic modeling of molten NaCl to accurately reproduce the properties from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The obtained neural network interatomic potential (NNIP) effectively captures the effects of both long-range and short-range interactions, which are crucial for modeling ionic liquids. Extensive validations suggest that the NNIP is capable of predicting the structural, thermophysical, and transport properties of molten NaCl as well as properties of crystalline NaCl, demonstrating near-DFT accuracy and 10(3) x higher efficiency in atomistic simulations. This application of NNIP suggests a paradigm shift from empirical/semiempirical/ab initio approaches to an efficient and accurate machine learning scheme in molten salt modeling.},

In this study, the lithium diffusion pathways in a series of large-scale a-Si models (512 atoms) with various extents of structural order are calculated using the machine learning interatomic potential. Then, the Li diffusion behavior in different atomistic environments is estimated from the transient state theory. The Li diffusion activation energy is observed to be lower (higher) in an ordered (disordered) local environment. The activation energy varies within the range of 1.21-1.46 eV, which agrees well with experimental measurements, 1.38-1.46 eV. Our simulations also show that Li diffusion is enhanced at higher Li concentration, which is consistent with experimental observations. The effects of structural disorder and Li concentration can be explained by the "trap" mechanism. Finally, we show that the sources of Li diffusion traps are dangling bonds and large voids in the a-Si matrix with the help of first-principles calculations. Our work provides insight into the Li diffusion mechanism, which is beneficial for improving the performance of a-Si anodes for lithium-ion batteries. In addition, we demonstrate the significant dependence of the ion transport behavior on the local atomic environment, which will be useful for future theoretical studies of technologically important amorphous materials beyond Si.}

This work applies the recently published on-the-fly machine-learned force field techniques using a variant of the Gaussian approximation potentials combined with Bayesian regression and molecular dynamics as efficiently implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package, VASP. The generation of these force fields follows active-learning schemes. We apply these force fields to simple oxides such as MgO and more complex reducible oxides such as iron oxide, examine their generalizability, and further increase complexity by studying water adsorption on these metal oxide surfaces. We successfully examined surface properties of pristine and reconstructed MgO and Fe3O4 surfaces. However, the accurate description of water–oxide interfaces by machine-learned force fields, especially for iron oxides, remains a field offering plenty of research opportunities.},

  abstract = {In scientific machine learning, regression networks have been recently applied to approximate solution maps (e.g., the potential-ground state map of the Schrodinger equation). In this paper, we aim to reduce the generalization error without spending more time on generating training samples. However, to reduce the generalization error, the regression network needs to be fit on a large number of training samples (e.g., a collection of potential-ground state pairs). The training samples can be produced by running numerical solvers, which takes significant time in many applications. In this paper, we aim to reduce the generalization error without spending more time on generating training samples. Inspired by few-shot learning techniques, we develop the multilevel fine-tuning algorithm by introducing levels of training: we first train the regression network on samples generated at the coarsest grid and then successively fine-tune the network on samples generated at finer grids. Within the same amount of time, numerical solvers generate more samples on coarse grids than on fine grids. We demonstrate a significant reduction of generalization error in numerical experiments on challenging problems with oscillations, discontinuities, or rough coefficients. Further analysis can be conducted in the neural tangent kernel regime, and we provide practical estimators to the generalization error. The number of training samples at different levels can be optimized for the smallest estimated generalization error under the constraint of budget for training data. The optimized distribution of budget over levels provides practical guidance with theoretical insight as in the celebrated multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm.},

  abstract = {Interaction potentials are critical to molecular dynamics simulations on fundamental mechanisms at atomic scales. Combination of well-developed single-element empirical potentials via cross interaction (CI) is an important and effective way to develop alloy embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials. In this work, based on neural-network (NN) models, firstly we proposed a framework to construct CI potential functions via utilizing single-element potentials. The framework contained four steps: (1) extracting characteristic points from single-element potential functions, (2) constructing CI functions by cubic spline interpolation, (3) evaluating the accuracy of CI functions by referring to first-principle (FP) data, and (4) searching for reasonable CI functions via NN models. Then with this framework, we developed a Zr-Nb alloy CI potential utilizing the MA-III (pure Zr potential developed by Mendelev and Ackland in 2007) and the Fellinger, Park and Wilkins (FPW) (pure Nb potential developed by FPW in 2010) potentials as single-element parts. The calculated results with this Zr-Nb alloy potential showed that: (1) the newly developed CI potential functions could simultaneously present the potential-function features of Zr and Nb; (2) the normalized energy-volume curves of L1(2) Zr3Nb, B2 ZrNb and L1(2) ZrNb3 calculated by this CI potential reasonably agreed with FP results; (3) the referred MA-III Zr and FPW Nb potentials can satisfactorily reproduce the priority of prismatic slip in Zr and the tension-compression asymmetry of {$<$} 111 \& rang;\{112\} slip in Nb, while other ab initio developed Zr-Nb alloy potentials cannot. Our study indicates that, this NN based framework can take full advantage of single-element potentials, and is very convenient to develop EAM potentials of alloys; moreover, the new-developed Zr-Nb alloy EAM potential can reasonably describe the complicated deformation behaviors in Zr-Nb systems.},

  abstract = {Neural network (NN) potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been widely used in atomistic simulations with ab initio accuracy. While constructing NN PESs, their training data points are often sampled by molecular dynamics trajectories. This strategy can be however inefficient for reactive systems involving rare events. Here, we develop an uncertainty-driven active learning strategy to automatically and efficiently generate high-dimensional NN-based reactive potentials, taking a gas−surface reaction as an example. The difference between two independent NN models is used as a simple and differentiable uncertainty metric, allowing us to quickly search in the uncertainty space and place new samples at which the PES is less reliable. By interfacing this algorithm with the firstprinciples simulation package, we demonstrate that a globally accurate NN potential of the H2 + Ag(111) system can be constructed with merely ∼150 data points. This PES can be further refined to describe H2 dissociation on Ag(100) by adding ∼130 more configurations on this facet. The entire process is completely automatic and self-terminated once the relative error criterion is fulfilled. Impressively, data points sampled by this uncertainty-driven strategy are substantially fewer than by the traditional trajectory-based sampling. The final NN PES not only converges well the quantum dissociation probability of the molecule but also well-reproduces the phonon properties of the substrate and is capable of describing surface temperature effects. These results show the potential of this active learning approach in developing high-dimensional NN reactive potentials in gas and condensed phases.},

However, precise spectral assignment cannot be carried out by conventional DFT for high-rate battery materials at room temperature. Herein, combining DFT calculation of paramagnetic shift and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to achieve the converged Na+ distribution at hundreds of nanoseconds, we obtain the statistically averaged paramagnetic shift, which is in excellent agreement with ssNMR measurements. Two Na-23 shifts induced by different stacking sequences of transition metal layers are revealed in the fast chemically exchanged NMR spectra of P2-type Na-2/3(Mg1/3Mn2/3)O-2 for the first time.

  abstract = {Deep neural network with rectified linear units (ReLU) is getting more and more popular recently. However, the derivatives of the function represented by a ReLU network are not continuous, which limit the usage of ReLU network to situations only when smoothness is not required. In this paper, we construct deep neural networks with rectified power units (RePU), which can give better approximations for smooth functions. Optimal algorithms are proposed to explicitly build neural networks with sparsely connected RePUs, which we call PowerNets, to represent polynomials with no approximation error. For general smooth functions, we first project the function to their polynomial approximations, then use the proposed algorithms to construct corresponding PowerNets. Thus, the error of best polynomial approximation provides an upper bound of the best RePU network approximation error. For smooth functions in higher dimensional Sobolev spaces, we use fast spectral transforms for tensor-product grid and sparse grid discretization to get polynomial approximations. Our constructive algorithms show clearly a close connection between spectral methods and deep neural networks: PowerNets with n hidden layers can exactly represent polynomials up to degree s(n), where s is the power of RePUs. The proposed PowerNets have potential applications in the situations where high-accuracy is desired or smoothness is required.},

Here we applied the recently developed deep potential molecular dynamics (DeePMD) approach to investigate the ion mobility in Na3OBr. With the deep potential model for Na3OBr constructed based on first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we directly calculate the Na+ diffusion coefficient at various temperatures, and obtain an activation energy of 0.42-0.43 eV. This in comparison with the 0 K migration barrier (0.41-0.43 eV) suggests that the finite temperature effect is negligible for Na3OBr. The model gives an extrapolated room temperature ionic conductivity of 1 x 10(-4)-2 x 10(-4) mS cm(-1), roughly in the same order of magnitude as the experimental results. We also confirm the proportionality of the diffusion coefficient with respect to the vacancy concentration, and find that the migration barrier is relatively insensitive to the vacancy concentration. This work further demonstrates the promising role of the DeePMD method in the study of the transport properties of solid-state electrolytes.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been extensively used to predict thermal properties, but simulating different phases with similar precision using a unified force field is often difficult because of the lack of accurate and transferrable interatomistic potential fields. As a result, this issue has become a major barrier to predicting the phase change of materials and their transport properties with atomistic-level modeling techniques. Recently, machine learning-based algorithms have emerged as promising tools to develop accurate potentials for MD simulations. In this work, we approach the problem of predicting the thermal conductivity of silicon in different phases by performing MD simulations with a deep neural network potential (NNP). This NNP is trained with ab initio data of silicon in the crystalline, liquid, and amorphous phases. The accuracy of our potential is first validated through reproducing the atomistic structures during the phase transition, where other empirical potentials usually fail. The thermal conductivity of different phases is then calculated, showing a good agreement with the experimental results and ab initio calculation results. Our work shows that a unified neural network ebased potential can be a promising tool for studying phase change and thermal transport of materials with high accuracy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

For discovery workflows to be predictive, we need automated, low-cost methods that can distinguish the regions of chemical space where DFT should be applied from those where it should not. We curate more than 4800 open-shell transition-metal complexes up to hundreds of atoms in size from prior high-throughput DFT studies and evaluate affordable, finite-temperature DFT fractional occupation number (FON)-based MR diagnostics. We show that intuitive measures of strong correlation (i.e., the HOMO-LUMO gap) are not predictive of MR character as judged by FON-based diagnostics. Analysis of independently trained machine learning (ML) models to predict HOMO-LUMO gaps and FON-based diagnostics reveals differences in the metal and ligand sensitivity of the two quantities. We use our trained ML models to rapidly evaluate MR character over a space of similar to 187000 theoretical complexes, identifying large-scale trends in spin-state-dependent MR character and finding small HOMO-LUMO gap complexes while ensuring low MR character.},

On the other hand, the DP method constructs a deep neural network that has a high accuracy in reproducing short- and long-ranged properties of warm dense Al when compared to the DFT methods. The DP method is orders of magnitudes faster than DFT and is well-suited for simulating large systems and long trajectories to yield accurate properties of warm dense Al.

However, predicting global electronic structure properties like Frontier molecular orbital highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and their HOMO-LUMO gaps from the small-sized molecule data to larger molecules remains a challenge. Here, we develop a multilevel attention neural network, named DeepMoleNet, to enable chemical interpretable insights being fused into multitask learning through (1) weighting contributions from various atoms and (2) taking the atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs) as the teacher descriptor. The efficient prediction of 12 properties including dipole moment, HOMO, and Gibbs free energy with in chemical accuracy is achieved by using multiple benchmarks, both at the equilibrium and nonequilibrium geometries, including up to 110,000 records of data in QM9, 400,000 records in MD17, and 280,000 records in ANI-1ccx for random split evaluation. The good transferability for predicting larger molecules outside the training set is demonstrated in both equilibrium QM9 and Alchemy data sets at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Additional tests on nonequilibrium molecular conformations from DFT-based MD17 data set and ANI-1ccx data set with coupled cluster accuracy as well as the public test sets of singlet fission molecules, biomolecules, long oligomers, and protein with up to 140 atoms show reasonable predictions for thermodynamics and electronic structure properties. The proposed multilevel attention neural network is applicable to high-throughput screening of numerous chemical species in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular spaces to accelerate rational designs of drug-like molecules, material candidates, and chemical reactions.},

As such it is desirable to train a model using the absolute minimal data set possible, especially when costs of high-fidelity calculations such as CCSD and QMC are high. Here, we present an Active Learning approach that starts with minimal number of training data points, iteratively samples the energy landscape using nested ensemble Monte Carlo to identify regions of failure and retrains the neural network on-the-fly to improve its performance. We find that this approach is able to train a neural network to reproduce thermodynamic, structure and transport properties of bulk liquid water by sampling less than 300 configurations and their energies. This study reports a new active learning scheme with a promising sampling and training strategy to develop accurate force-fields for molecular simulations using extremely sparse training data sets. The approach is quite generic and can be easily extended to other classes or materials. Abstract Neural Network (NN) based potentials represent flexible alternatives to pre-defined functional forms. Well-trained NN potentials are transferable and provide high level of accuracy on-par with the reference model used for training. Despite their tremendous potentials and interests, there are at least two challenges that need to be addressed-(1) NN models are interpolative and hence trained by generating large quantities (∼ 10 4 or greater) of structural data in hopes that the model has adequately sampled the energy landscape both near and far-from-equilibrium. It is desirable to minimize the number of training data, especially if the underlying reference model is expensive. (2) NN atomistic potentials (like any other classical atomistic model) are limited in the time scales they can access. Coarse-grained NN potentials have emerged as a viable alternative. Here, we address these challenges by introducing an active learning scheme that trains a CG model with minimal amount of training data. Our active learning workflow starts with a sparse training dataset (∼1 to 5 data points) which is continually updated via a Nested Ensemble Monte Carlo scheme that iteratively queries the energy landscape in regions of failure and improves the network performance. We demonstrate that with ∼300 reference data, our AL-NN is able to accurately predict both the energies and the molecular forces of water, within 2 meV/molecule and 40 meV/Å of the reference (coarse-grained bond-order potential) model. The AL-NN water model provides good prediction of several structural, thermodynamic, and temperature dependent properties of liquid water, with values close to those obtained from the reference model. AL-NN also captures the well-known density anomaly of liquid water observed in experiments. While the AL procedure has been demonstrated for training CG models with sparse},

  abstract = {Small metal clusters are of fundamental scientific interest and of tremendous significance in catalysis. These nanoscale clusters display diverse geometries and structural motifs depending on the cluster size; a knowledge of this size-dependent structural motifs and their dynamical evolution has been of longstanding interest. Given the high computational cost of first-principles calculations, molecular modeling and atomistic simulations such as molecular dynamics (MD) has proven to be an important complementary tool to aid this understanding. Classical MD typically employ predefined functional forms which limits their ability to capture such complex size-dependent structural and dynamical transformation. Neural Network (NN) based potentials represent flexible alternatives and in principle, well-trained NN potentials can provide high level of flexibility, transferability and accuracy on-par with the reference model used for training. A major challenge, however, is that NN models are interpolative and requires large quantities (∼ 10 4 or greater) of training data to ensure that the model adequately samples the energy landscape both near and far-from-equilibrium. A highly desirable goal is minimize the number of training data, especially if the underlying reference model is first-principles based and hence expensive. Here, we introduce an active learning (AL) scheme that trains a NN model on-the-fly with minimal amount of first-principles based training data. Our AL workflow is initiated with a sparse training dataset (∼ 1 to 5 data points) and is updated on-the-fly via a Nested Ensemble Monte Carlo scheme that iteratively queries the energy landscape in regions of failure and updates the training pool to improve the network performance. Using a representative system of gold clusters, we demonstrate that our AL workflow can train a NN with ∼ 500 total reference calculations. Using an extensive DFT test set of ∼ 1100 configurations, we show that our AL-NN is able to accurately predict both the DFT energies and the forces for clusters of a myriad of different sizes. Our NN predictions are within 30 meV/atom and 40 meV/ ˚ A of the reference DFT calculations. Moreover, our AL-NN model also adequately captures the various size-dependent structural and dynamical properties of gold clusters in excellent agreement with DFT calculations and available experiments.

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics with predefined functional forms is a popular technique for understanding dynamical evolution of systems. The predefined functional forms impose limits on the physics that can be captured. Artificial neural network (ANN) models have emerged as an attractive flexible alternative to the expensive quantum calculations (e.g., density functional theory) in the area of molecular force-fields. Ideally, if one is able to train a ANN to accurately predict the correct DFT energy and forces for any given structure, they gain the ability to perform molecular dynamics with high accuracy while simultaneously reducing the computation cost in a dramatic fashion. While this goal is very lucrative, neural networks are interpolative and therefore, it is not always clear how one should go about training a neural network to exhaustively fit the entire phase space of a given system. Currently, ANNs are trained by generating large quantities (on the order of 104 or greater) of training data in hopes that the ANN has adequately sampled the energy landscape both near and far-from-equilibrium. This can, however, be a bit prohibitive when it comes to more accurate levels of quantum theory. As such, it is desirable to train a model using the absolute minimal data set possible, especially when costs of high-fidelity calculations such as CCSD and QMC are high. Here, we present an active learning approach that iteratively trains an ANN model to faithfully replicate the coarse-grained energy surface of water clusters using only 426 total structures in its training data. Our active learning workflow starts with a sparse training data set which is continually updated via a Nested Ensemble Monte Carlo scheme that sparsely queries the energy landscape and tests the network performance. Next, the network is retrained with an updated training set that includes failed configurations/energies from previous iteration until convergence is attained. Once trained, we generate an extensive test set of 100 »000 configurations sampled across clusters ranging from 1 to 200 molecules and demonstrate that the trained network adequately reproduces the energies (within mean absolute error (MAE) of 2 meV/molecule) and forces (MAE 40 meV/Å) compared to the reference model. More importantly, the trained ANN model also accurately captures both the structure as well as the free energy as a function of the various cluster sizes. Overall, this study reports a new active learning scheme with promising strategy to develop accurate force-fields for molecular simulations using extremely sparse training data sets.}

  abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are commonly derived based on empirical observations. However, recent advances of technology enable us to collect and store massive amount of data, which offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of PDEs. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called PDE-Net 2.0, to discover (time-dependent) PDEs from observed dynamic data with minor prior knowledge on the underlying mechanism that drives the dynamics. The design of PDE-Net 2.0 is based on our earlier work [1] where the original version of PDE-Net was proposed. PDE-Net 2.0 is a combination of numerical approximation of differential operators by convolutions and a symbolic multi-layer neural network for model recovery. Comparing with existing approaches, PDE-Net 2.0 has the most flexibility and expressive power by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net 2.0 has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.

  abstract = {Prediction of material properties from first principles is often a computationally expensive task. Recently, artificial neural networks and other machine learning approaches have been successfully employed to obtain accurate models at a low computational cost by leveraging existing example data. Here, we present a software package "Properties from Artificial Neural Network Architectures'' (PANNA) that provides a comprehensive toolkit for creating neural network models for atomistic systems following the Behler-Parrinello topology. Besides the core routines for neural network training, it includes data parser, descriptor builder for Behler-Parrinello class of symmetry functions and forcefield generator suitable for integration within molecular dynamics packages. PANNA offers a variety of activation and cost functions, regularization methods, as well as the possibility of using fullyconnected networks with custom size for each atomic species. PANNA benefits from the optimization and hardware-flexibility of the underlying TensorFlow engine which allows it to be used on multiple CPU/GPU/TPU systems, making it possible to develop and optimize neural network models based on large datasets. Program summary Program title: PANNA-Properties from Artificial Neural Network Architectures CPC Library link to program files: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/mcryj6cnnh.1 Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: Python, C++ Nature of problem: A workflow for machine learning atomistic properties and interatomic potentials using neural networks. Solution method: This package first transforms the user supplied data into pairs of precomputed input (Behler-Parrinello [1] class of symmetry functions) and target output (energy and forces) for the neural network model. The data are then packed to enable efficient reading. A user-friendly interface to TensorFlow [2] is provided to instantiate and train neural network models with varying architectures within Behler-Parrinello topology and with varying training schedules. The training can be monitored and validated with the provided tools. The derivative of the target output with respect to the input can also be used jointly in training, e.g. in the case of energy and force training. The interface with molecular dynamics codes such as LAMMPS [3] allows the neural network model to be used as an interatomic potential. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The underlying neural network training engine, TensorFlow, is a prerequisite of PANNA. While there is a special LAMMPS integration performed via a patch distributed within PANNA, the network potentials can be deposited into OpenKIM [4] database and can be used with a wide range of molecular dynamics codes. The package allows different network architectures to be used for each atomic species, with different trainability setting for each network layer. It provides tools of exchanging weights between atomic species, and provides the option of building a Radial Basis Function network. The software is parallelized to take advantage of hardware architectures with multiple CPU/GPU/TPUs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The microstructures of materials determine their macroscopic properties. The traditional bottom up multi-scale approach provides a general strategy for studying the relationship between microstructures and physical properties. However, there are still many difficulties in microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic modeling of materials, and the bridging of different scale models is extremely challenging. With the advancement of computing power in Moore's Law, and the explosive development of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, data-driven methods are commonly used, and in crystal structure prediction, stability analysis, equation of states, optical properties, chemical synthesis, etc. have achieved good application results. The fast calculation speed and reliable prediction capabilities of deep learning can greatly improve the efficiency of material simulation. Its wide applicability provides new research ideas for some traditional problems in material microstructures and multi-scale simulations. It is expected to promote the study of material microstructures and physical properties, and to provide new research directions for modelling macroscopic physical properties based on micro-mesoscopic mechanism and prediction of material properties to meet engineering application requirements. This review article will briefly introduce the basic principles of deep learning and main types of commonly used neural networks, outline the main methods of material microstructures and multi-scale modeling, and then introduce the recent progress of deep learning method in the study of material microstruc-ture and physical properties, and review the developments and prospects of deep learning method in the field of multi-scale simulation of materials.

Molecular dynamics simulations based on a deep neural network potential trained by ab initio data show that the viscosity of MgSiO3 melt decreases with increasing pressure at low pressures (up to ∼6 GPa) before it starts to increase with further compression. The melt electrical conductivity also behaves anomalously; first increasing and then decreasing with pressure. The melt accumulation implied by the viscosity turnover at ∼23 GPa along mantle liquidus offers an explanation for the low-velocity zone at the 660-km discontinuity. The increase in electrical conductivity up to ∼50 GPa may contribute to the steep rise of Earth's electrical conductivity profiles derived from magnetotelluric observations. Our results also suggest that small fraction of melts could give rise to detectable bulk conductivity in deeper parts of the mantle.},

  abstract = {Diffusional isotope fractionation has been widely used to explain lithium (Li) isotope variations in minerals and rocks. Isotopic mass dependence of Li diffusion can be empirically expressed as D7LiD6Li=67β, where D is the diffusivity of a Li isotope. The knowledge about temperature and compositional dependence of the β factor which is essential for understanding diffusion profiles and mechanisms remains unclear. Based on the potential energy and interatomic forces generated by deep neural networks trained with ab initio data, we performed deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations of several Li pseudo-isotopes (with mass = 2, 7, 21, 42 g/mol) in albite, hydrous albite, and model basalt melts to evaluate the β factor. Our calculated diffusivities for 7Li in albite and model basalt melts at 1800 K compare well with experimental results. We found that β in albite melt decreases from 0.267±0.006 at 4000 K to 0.225±0.004 at 1800 K. The presence of water appears to slightly weaken the temperature dependence of β, with β decreasing from 0.250±0.012 to 0.228±0.031 in hydrous albite melt. The calculated β in model basalt melt takes much smaller values, decreasing from 0.215±0.006 at 4000 K to 0.132±0.015 at 1800 K. Our prediction of β in albite and hydrous albite melts is in good agreement with experimental data. More importantly, our results suggest that Li isotope diffusion in silicate melts is strongly dependent on melt composition. The temperature and compositional effects on β can be qualitatively explained in terms of ionic porosity and the coupled relationship between Li diffusion and the mobility of the silicate melt network. Two types of diffusion experiments are suggested to test our predicted temperature and compositional dependence of β. This study shows that DPMD is a promising tool to simulate the diffusion of elements and isotopes in silicate melts.},

  abstract = {The use of neural networks to predict molecular properties calculated from high level quantum mechanical calculations has made significant advances in recent years, but most models need input geometries from DFT optimizations which limit their applicability in practice. In this work, we explored how machine learning can be used to predict molecular atomization energies and conformation stability using optimized geometries from Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF). On the basis of the recently introduced deep tensor neural network (DTNN) approach, we first improved its training efficiency and performed an extensive search of its hyperparameters, and developed a DTNN\_7ib model which has a test accuracy of 0.34 kcal/mol mean absolute error (MAE) on QM9 data set. Then using atomic vector representations in the DTNN\_7ib model, we employed transfer learning (TL) strategy to train readout layers on the QM9(M) data set, in which QM properties are the same as in QM9 [calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level] while molecular geometries are corresponding local minima optimized with MMFF94 force field. The developed TL\_QM9(M) model can achieve an MAE of 0.79 kcal/mol using MMFF optimized geometries. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the same transfer learning strategy with the same atomic vector representation can be used to develop a machine learning model that can achieve an MAE of 0.51 kcal/mol in molecular energy prediction using MMFF geometries for an eMol9\_C-M conformation data set, which consists of 9959 molecules and 88 234 conformations with energies calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Our results indicate that DFT-level accuracy of molecular energy prediction can be achieved using force-field optimized geometries and atomic vector representations learned from deep tensor neural network, and integrated molecular modeling and machine learning would be a promising approach to develop more powerful computational tools for molecular conformation analysis.},

  abstract = {Many large scale problems in computational fluid dynamics such as uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inversion, data assimilation and PDE constrained optimization are considered very challenging computationally as they require a large number of expensive (forward) numerical solutions of the corresponding PDEs. We propose a machine learning algorithm, based on deep artificial neu-ral networks, that predicts the underlying input parameters to observable map from a few training samples (computed realizations of this map). By a judicious combination of theoretical arguments and empirical observations, we find suitable network architectures and training hyperparameters that result in robust and efficient neural network approximations of the parameters to observable map. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate low prediction errors for the trained network networks, even when the network has been trained with a few samples, at a computational cost which is several orders of magnitude lower than the underlying PDE solver. Moreover, we combine the proposed deep learning algorithm with Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to efficiently compute uncertainty propagation for nonlinear PDEs. Under the assumption that the underlying neural networks generalize well, we prove that the deep learning MC and QMC algorithms are guaranteed to be faster than the baseline (quasi-) Monte Carlo methods. Numerical experiments demonstrating one to two orders of magnitude speed up over baseline QMC and MC algorithms, for the intricate problem of computing probability distributions of the observable, are also presented.},

However, most NNFF methods for complex multi-element atomic systems indirectly predict atomic force vectors by exploiting just atomic structure rotation-invariant features and network-feature spatial derivatives, which are computationally expensive. Here, we show a staggered NNFF architecture that exploits both rotation-invariant and -covariant features to directly predict atomic force vectors without using spatial derivatives, and we demonstrate 2.2x NNFF-MD acceleration over a state-of-the-art C++ engine using a Python engine. This fast architecture enables us to develop NNFF for complex ternary- and quaternary-element extended systems composed of long polymer chains, amorphous oxide and surface chemical reactions. The rotation-invariant-covariant architecture described here can also directly predict complex covariant vector outputs from local environments, in other domains beyond computational material science. Neural network force fields promise to bypass the computationally expensive quantum mechanical calculations typically required to investigate complex materials, such as lithium-ion batteries. Mailoa et al. accelerate these approaches with an architecture that exploits both rotation-invariant and -covariant features separately.},

  abstract = {High-strength metal alloys achieve their performance via careful control of precipitates and solutes. The nucleation, growth, and kinetics of precipitation, and the resulting mechanical properties, are inherently atomic scale phenomena, particularly during early-stage nucleation and growth. Atomistic modeling using interatomic potentials is a desirable tool for understanding the detailed phenomena involved in precipitation and strengthening, which requires length and timescales far larger than those accessible by first-principles methods. Current interatomic potentials for alloys are not, however, sufficiently accurate for such studies. Here a family of neural-network potentials (NNPs) for the Al-Cu system are presented as a first example of a machine learning potential that can achieve near-first-principles accuracy for many different metallurgically important aspects of this alloy. High-fidelity predictions of intermetallic compounds, elastic constants, dilute solid-solution energetics, precipitate-matrix interfaces, generalized stacking fault energies and surfaces for slip in matrix and precipitates, antisite defect energies, and other quantities, are shown. The NNPs also captures the subtle entropically induced transition between θ′ and θ at temperatures around 600 K. Many comparisons are made with the state-of-the-art angular-dependent potential for Al-Cu, demonstrating the significant quantitative benefit of a machine learning approach. A preliminary kinetic Monte Carlo study shows the NNP to predict the emergence of GP zones in Al-4at\%Cu at T=300 K in agreement with experiments. These studies show that the NNP has significant transferability to defects and properties outside the structures used to train the NNP but also shows some errors highlighting that the use of any interatomic potential requires careful validation in application to specific metallurgical problems of interest.}

  abstract = {The origin of water anomalies hides in an experimentally inaccessible region of the phase diagram known as no-man's land, bounded at low temperature by the domain of stability of amorphous glasses, and at high temperature by the homogeneous nucleation line, below which liquid water loses its metastability. The existence of at least two different forms of glass on one side, i.e., the low-density amorphous (LDA) and the high-density amorphous (HDA) ices, and of one anomalous liquid on the other side, points to a hidden connection between these states, whose understanding has the potential to uncover what happens in no-man's land and shed light on the complex nature of water's behavior. Here, we develop a Neural Network scheme capable of discerning local structures beyond tetrahedrality. Applied over a wide region of the water's phase diagram, we show that the local structures that characterize both LDA and HDA amorphous phases are indeed embedded in the supercooled liquid phase. Remarkably, the rapid increase in the LDA-like population with supercooling occurs in the same temperature and pressure region where thermodynamic fluctuations are maximized, linking these structures with water's anomalies. At the same time, the population of HDA-like environments rapidly increases with pressure, becoming the majority component at high density. Our results show that both LDA and HDA are genuine glasses, and provide a microscopic connection between the non-equilibrium and equilibrium phase diagrams of water.},

Traditional potentials have served in this capacity for over three decades. Recently, a new class of potentials has emerged, which is based on a radically different philosophy. The new potentials are constructed using machine-learning (ML) methods and a massive reference database generated by quantum-mechanical calculations. While the traditional potentials are derived from physical insights into the nature of chemical bonding, the ML potentials utilize a high-dimensional mathematical regression to interpolate between the reference energies. We review the current status of the interatomic potential field, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the traditional and ML potentials. A third class of potentials is introduced, in which an ML model is coupled with a physics-based potential to improve the transferability to unknown atomic environments. The discussion is focused on potentials intended for materials science applications. Possible future directions in this field are outlined.},

  abstract = {We show how to speed up global optimization of molecular structures using machine learning methods. To represent the molecular structures, we introduce the auto-bag feature vector that combines (i) a local feature vector for each atom, (ii) an unsupervised clustering of such feature vectors for many atoms across several structures, and (iii) a count for a given structure of how many times each cluster is represented. During subsequent global optimization searches, accumulated structure-energy relations of relaxed structural candidates are used to assign local energies to each atom using supervised learning. Specifically, the local energies follow from assigning energies to each cluster of local feature vectors and demanding the sum of local energies to amount to the structural energies in the least squares sense. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated in basin hopping searches for 19-atom structures described by single- or double-well Lennard-Jones type potentials and for 24-atom carbon structures described by density functional theory. In all cases, utilizing the local energy information derived on-the-fly enhances the rate at which the global minimum energy structure is found. Published by AIP Publishing.},

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques applied to chemical reactions has a long history. The present contribution discusses applications ranging from small molecule reaction dynamics to platforms for reaction planning. ML-based techniques can be of particular interest for problems which involve both, computation and experiments. For one, Bayesian inference is a powerful approach to include knowledge from experiment in improving computational models. ML-based methods can also be used to handle problems that are formally intractable using conventional approaches, such as exhaustive characterization of state-to-state information in reactive collisions. Finally, the explicit simulation of reactive networks as they occur in combustion has become possible using machine-learned neural network potentials. This review provides an overview of the questions that can and have been addressed using machine learning techniques and an outlook discusses challenges in this diverse and stimulating field. It is concluded that ML applied to chemistry problems as practiced and conceived today has the potential to transform the way with which the field approaches problems involving chemical reactions, both, in research and academic teaching.},

In this work, we have studied a far from equilibrium system of liquid to crystal Si growth using ML-FF. We found that our ML-FF based on ab initio decomposed atomic energy can reproduce all the aspects of ab initio simulated growth, from local energy fluctuations to transition temperatures, to diffusion constant, and growth rates. We have also compared the growth simulation with the Stillinger-Weber classical force field and found significant differences. A procedure is also provided to correct a systematic fitting bias in the ML-FF training process, which exists in all training models, otherwise critical results like transition temperature will be wrong.}

First, we evaluated all existing experimental data currently limited by thermodynamic functions of 10 silver substances (AgH, AgF, AgBr, AgI, Ag-2, Ag2S, Ag2Se, Ag2Te, AgCN, AgPO2). The mean average deviation between computed and experimental heats of formation was found to be 1.9 kcal/mol. Notably, all predicted heats of formation turned out to be within the error bounds of their experimental counterparts. Second, we predicted heats of formation and entropies for additional 90 silver species with no experimental data available, substantially enriching silver thermochemistry. Combination of gas phase heats of formation Delta H-f and entropies S degrees of AgNO2, AgSCN, Ag2SO4, and Ag2SeO4 obtained in this work, with respective solid-state information, resulted in accurate sublimation thermochemistry of these compounds. Complementation of predicted Delta H-f with heats of formation of some neutrals and positive ions produced 33 silver bond strengths of high reliability. Obtained thermochemical data are promising for developing the concepts of silver chemistry. In addition, derived heats of formation and bond dissociation enthalpies, due to their high diversity, are found to be relevant for testing and training of computational chemistry methods.},

In this study, by considering simple liquids, we explore the feasibility of significantly reducing the MD simulation time to compute various properties of monatomic systems such as the structure, pressure, and isothermal compressibility. To do so, extensive MD simulations are performed on 12 000 distinct Lennard-Jones systems at various thermodynamic states. Then, a deep denoising autoencoder network is trained to take the radial distribution function (RDF) from a single snapshot of a Lennard-Jones liquid to compute the mean, temporally averaged RDF. We show that the method is successful in the prediction of RDF and other properties such as the pressure and isothermal compressibility that can be computed based on the RDF not only for Lennard-Jones liquids at various thermodynamic states but also for various simple liquids described by exponential, Yukawa, and inverse-power-law pair potentials.},

  abstract = {In this work, we apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect gravitational wave (GW) signals of compact binary coalescences, using single-interferometer data from real LIGO detectors. Here, we adopted a resampling white-box approach to advance towards a statistical understanding of uncertainties intrinsic to CNNs in GW data analysis. We used Morlet wavelets to convert strain time series to time-frequency images. Moreover, we only worked with data of non-Gaussian noise and hardware injections, removing freedom to set signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in GW templates by hand, in order to reproduce more realistic experimental conditions. After hyperparameter adjustments, we found that resampling through repeated k-fold cross-validation smooths the stochasticity of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent present in accuracy perturbations by a factor of 3.6. CNNs are quite precise to detect noise, 0.952 for H1 data and 0.932 for L1 data; but, not sensitive enough to recall GW signals, 0.858 for H1 data and 0.768 for L1 data—although recall values are dependent on expected SNR.

  abstract = {Atomistic simulations have become an invaluable tool for industrial applications ranging from the optimization of protein-ligand interactions for drug discovery to the design of new materials for energy applications. Here we review recent advances in the use of machine learning (ML) methods for accelerated simulations based on a quantum mechanical (QM) description of the system. We show how recent progress in ML methods has dramatically extended the applicability range of conventional QM-based simulations, allowing to calculate industrially relevant properties with enhanced accuracy, at reduced computational cost, and for length and time scales that would have otherwise not been accessible. We illustrate the benefits of ML-accelerated atomistic simulations for industrial R\&D processes by showcasing relevant applications from two very different areas, drug discovery (pharmaceuticals) and energy materials. Writing from the perspective of both a molecular and a materials modeling scientist, this review aims to provide a unified picture of the impact of ML-accelerated atomistic simulations on the pharmaceutical, chemical, and materials industries and gives an outlook on the exciting opportunities that could emerge in the future.},

  abstract = {As electronic structure simulations continue to grow in size, the system-size scaling of computational costs increases in importance relative to cost prefactors. Presently, linear-scaling costs for three-dimensional systems are only attained by localized or randomized algorithms that have large cost prefactors in the difficult regime of low-temperature metals. Using large copper clusters in a minimal-basis semiempirical model as our reference system, we study the costs of these algorithms relative to a conventional cubic-scaling algorithm using matrix diagonalization and a recent quadratic-scaling algorithm using sparse matrix factorization and rational function approximation. The linear-scaling algorithms are competitive at the high temperatures relevant for warm dense matter, but their cost prefactors are prohibitive near ambient temperatures. To further reduce costs, we consider hybridized algorithms that combine localized and randomized algorithms. While simple hybridized algorithms do not improve performance, more sophisticated algorithms using recent concepts from structured linear algebra show promising initial performance results on a simple-cubic orthogonal tight-binding model.},

In this article, we quantify how accurately deep neural networks can learn the properties of disordered quantum systems as a function of the system size. We implement a scalable convolutional network that can address arbitrary system sizes. This network is compared with a recently introduced extensive convolutional architecture [K. Mills et al., Chem. Sci. 10, 4129 (2019)] and with conventional dense networks with all-to-all connectivity. The networks are trained to predict the exact ground-state energies of various disordered systems, namely a continuous-space single-particle Hamiltonian for cold-atoms in speckle disorder, and different setups of a quantum Ising chain with random couplings, including one with only short-range interactions and one augmented with a long-range term. In all testbeds we consider, the scalable network retains high accuracy as the system size increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the network scalability enables a transfer-learning protocol, whereby a pre-training performed on small systems drastically accelerates the learning of large-system properties, allowing reaching high accuracy with small training sets. In fact, with the scalable network one can even extrapolate to sizes larger than those included in the training set, accurately reproducing the results of state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations.},

We also explore efficient ways to reduce the number of walkers required for the accurate tracking of the MEP and generate initial positions automatically. We apply the whole scheme to the Lennard-Jones argon cluster with 7-38 atoms to demonstrate the successful tracking of the reaction paths. This achievement paves the path to non-empirical simulation of rare reactions without coarse-graining or artificial potential.},

Specifically, we find that neural network potentials based on local representations of atomic environments are capable of describing bulk liquid properties, but can fail at liquid-vapor interfaces. This failure results from the unbalanced attractions that build up in the presence of broken translation symmetry from long-ranged interactions, but cancel in the translational invariant bulk. By incorporating explicit models of the slowly-varying long-ranged interactions and training neural networks only on the short ranged components, we can arrive at potentials that robustly recover interfacial properties. We find that local neural network models can sometimes approximate a local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn. Generally, we find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier to train and have higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in a simple model of an asymmetric dipolar fluid where the exact long-ranged interaction is known, and in an ab initio water model where it is approximated.},

While it has become clear that low-order density correlations do not provide a complete representation of an atomic environment, the exponential increase in the number of possible N-body invariants makes it difficult to design a concise and effective representation. We discuss how to exploit recursion relations between equivariant features of different order (generalizations of N-body invariants that provide a complete representation of the symmetries of improper rotations) to compute high-order terms efficiently. In combination with the automatic selection of the most expressive combination of features at each order, this approach provides a conceptual and practical framework to generate systematically improvable, symmetry adapted representations for atomistic machine learning.},

  abstract = {Successful and cost-effective water splitting could be one of the most interesting energy sources of the future. The modification of the transition metal oxide rutile-TiO2 as photocatalyst can lead to improved performance in the water splitting process. For that purpose, an accurate description of the interaction potential of a water molecule and the rutile-TiO2(110) surface in the ground and electronically excited state after photoexcitation is crucial. The electronic Schrodinger equation for the states involved is solved pointwise for different nuclear configurations within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and accurate fits to these energy points are required to obtain an analytic expression for the potential energy surface. This is too computationally expensive for fine-grained surface calculations of quantum chemical models. In this paper, we propose to use state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to provide accurate fits for this problem. Namely, we employ a fully connected variant of ResNet and DenseNet with heavy regularization (L2, RReLU, Dropout, and BatchNormalization). Previous literature applied neural network approaches before, but with unsatisfactory accuracy. In an experimental evaluation we show that the root mean squared error (RMSE) can be 6.8 times lower for the exited state and 12.7 times lower for the ground state compared to former approaches.},

In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the utilization of ML algorithms to assist molecular simulations, followed by its applications in the field of catalysis.

  abstract = {In recent years the development of machine learning potentials (MLPs) has become a very active field of research. Numerous approaches have been proposed, which allow one to perform extended simulations of large systems at a small fraction of the computational costs of electronic structure calculations. The key to the success of modern MLPs is the close-to first principles quality description of the atomic interactions. This accuracy is reached by using very flexible functional forms in combination with high-level reference data from electronic structure calculations. These data sets can include up to hundreds of thousands of structures covering millions of atomic environments to ensure that all relevant features of the potential energy surface are well represented. The handling of such large data sets is nowadays becoming one of the main challenges in the construction of MLPs. In this paper we present a method, the bin-and-hash (BAH) algorithm, to overcome this problem by enabling the efficient identification and comparison of large numbers of multidimensional vectors. Such vectors emerge in multiple contexts in the construction of MLPs. Examples are the comparison of local atomic environments to identify and avoid unnecessary redundant information in the reference data sets that is costly in terms of both the electronic structure calculations as well as the training process, the assessment of the quality of the descriptors used as structural fingerprints in many types of MLPs, and the detection of possibly unreliable data points. The BAH algorithm is illustrated for the example of high-dimensional neural network potentials using atom-centered symmetry functions for the geometrical description of the atomic environments, but the method is general and can be combined with any current type of MLP.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in the development of machine learning potentials (MLPs) for biomolecular simulations, there has been limited effort in developing stable and accurate MLPs for enzymatic reactions. Here, we report a protocol for performing machine learning assisted free energy simulation of solution-phase and enzyme reactions at an ab initio quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) level of accuracy. Within our protocol, the MLP is built to reproduce the ai-QM/MM energy as well as forces on both QM (reactive) and MM (solvent/enzyme) atoms. As an alternative strategy, a delta machine learning potential (DMLP) is trained to reproduce the differences between ai-QM/MM and semi-empirical (se) QM/MM energy and forces. To account for the effect of the condensed-phase environment in both MLP and DMLP, the DeePMD representation of a molecular system is extended to incorporate external electrostatic potential and field on each QM atom. Using the Menshutkin and chorismate mutase reactions as examples , we show that the developed MLP and DMLP reproduce the ai-QM/MM energy and forces with an error on average less than 1.0 kcal/mol and 1.0 kcal/mol/Å for representative configurations along the reaction pathway. For both reactions, MLP/DMLP-based simulations yielded free energy profiles that differed by less than 1.0 kcal/mol from the reference ai-QM/MM results, but only at a fractional computational cost.},

The developed machine learning potential is validated by comparing partial radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and partial structure factors with AIMD and PIM potential. The machine learning potential yields a more precise description of the microstructures than the PIM potential which suffers from the analytical form.

The proposed machine learning potential was validated with the obtained partial radial distribution functions and the coordination numbers with the AIMD. The structural and thermophysical evolutions with temperature over the entire operating temperature range were documented. Adding Na+ and K+ ions deteriorated the network by corner-sharing and edge-sharing ZnCl4 tetrahedra, and apparently affected self-diffusion coefficient, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of the melt. The calculated thermophysical properties agreed with experimental data. A negative temperature dependence of thermal conductivity was noted and discussed. Based on the experimental data, viscosity data by Li et al. and those of this work, yielded reliable experimental values in the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher form.},

  abstract = {The generic problem in supervised machine learning is to learn a function f from a collection of samples, with the objective of predicting the value taken by f for any given input. In effect, the learning procedure consists in constructing an explicit function that approximates f in some sense. In this article is introduced a Fourier-based machine learning method which could be an alternative or a complement to neural networks for applications in engineering. The basic idea is to extend f into a periodic function so as to use partial sums of the Fourier series as approximations. For this approach to be effective in high dimension, it proved necessary to use several ideas and concepts such as regularization, Sobol sequences and hyperbolic crosses. An attractive feature of the proposed method is that the training stage reduces to a quadratic programming problem. The presented method is first applied to some examples of high-dimensional analytical functions, which allows some comparisons with neural networks to be made. An application to a homogenization problem in nonlinear conduction is discussed in detail. Various examples related to global sensitivity analysis, assessing effective energies of microstructures, and solving boundary value problems are presented.},

  abstract = {The efficient treatment of long-range interactions for point clouds is a challenging problem in many scientific machine learning applications. To extract global information, one usually needs a large window size, a large number of layers, and/or a large number of channels. This can often significantly increase the computational cost. In this work, we present a novel neural network layer that directly incorporates long-range information for a point cloud. This layer, dubbed the long-range convolutional (LRC)-layer, leverages the convolutional theorem coupled with the non-uniform Fourier transform. In a nutshell, the LRC-layer mollifies the point cloud to an adequately sized regular grid, computes its Fourier transform, multiplies the result by a set of trainable Fourier multipliers, computes the inverse Fourier transform, and finally interpolates the result back to the point cloud. The resulting global all-to-all convolution operation can be performed in nearly-linear time asymptotically with respect to the number of input points. The LRC-layer is a particularly powerful tool when combined with local convolution as together they offer efficient and seamless treatment of both short and long range interactions. We showcase this framework by introducing a neural network architecture that combines LRC-layers with short-range convolutional layers to accurately learn the energy and force associated with a N -body potential. We also exploit the induced two-level decomposition and propose an efficient strategy to train the combined architecture with a reduced number of samples.},

  abstract = {Ice Ih, the common form of ice in the biosphere, contains proton disorder. Its proton-ordered counterpart, ice XI, is thermodynamically stable below 72 K. However, the formation of ice XI is kinetically hindered, and experimentally it is obtained by doping with KOH. Doping creates ionic defects that promote the migration of protons and the associated change in proton configuration. In this article, we mimic the effect of doping with a bias potential that enhances the formation of ionic defects in molecular dynamics simulations. The recombination of the ions thus formed proceeds through fast migration of the hydroxide along hydrogen bond loops, providing a physical and expedite way to change the proton configuration. A key ingredient of this approach is a machine learning potential trained with density functional theory data and capable of modelling molecular dissociation. We exemplify the usefulness of this idea by studying the order-disorder transition using an appropriate order parameter that distinguishes the proton environments in ice Ih and XI. We calculate the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy associated with the transition. Our estimated entropy agrees with experiment within the error bars of the calculation.},

Here, we use one such model as well as direct density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the phase equilibrium of water, hexagonal ice (Ih), and cubic ice (Ic), with an eye toward studying ice nucleation. The machine learning model is based on deep neural networks and has been trained on DFT data obtained using the SCAN exchange and correlation functional. We use this model to drive enhanced sampling simulations aimed at calculating a number of complex properties that are out of reach of DFT-driven simulations and then employ an appropriate reweighting procedure to compute the corresponding properties for the SCAN functional. This approach allows us to calculate the melting temperature of both ice polymorphs, the driving force for nucleation, the heat of fusion, the densities at the melting temperature, the relative stability of ices Ih and Ic, and other properties. We find a correct qualitative prediction of all properties of interest. In some cases, quantitative agreement with experiment is better than for state-of-the-art semiempirical potentials for water. Our results also show that SCAN correctly predicts that ice Ih is more stable than ice Ic.},

Each ML method comprises a mathematically well-defined procedure, and an increasingly larger number of easy-to-use ML packages for modeling atomistic systems are becoming available. In this Perspective, we discuss the general aspects of ML techniques in the context of creating ML force fields. We describe common features of ML modeling and quantum-mechanical approximations, so-called global and local ML models, and the physical differences behind these two classes of approaches. Finally, we describe the recent developments and emerging directions in the field of ML-driven molecular modeling.

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is applied to simulate non-adiabatic molecular dynamics of phenanthrene, using the time-dependent density functional based tight binding (TD-DFTB) approach for excited states combined with mixed quantum-classical propagation. Reference calculations rely on Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm coupled to TD-DFTB, which provides electronic relaxation dynamics in fair agreement with various available experimental results. Aiming at describing the coupled electron-nuclei dynamics in large molecular systems, we then examine the combination of DL for excited-state potential energy surfaces (PESs) with a simplified trajectory surface hopping propagation based on the Belyaev-Lebedev (BL) scheme. We start to assess the accuracy of the TD-DFTB approach upon comparison of the optical spectrum with experimental and higher-level theoretical results. Using the recently developed SchNetPack (Schutt et al 2019 J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15 448-55) for DL applications, we train several models and evaluate their performance in predicting excited-state energies and forces. Then, the main focus is given to the analysis of the electronic population of low-lying excited states computed with the aforementioned methods. We determine the relaxation timescales and compare them with experimental data. Our results show that DL demonstrates its ability to describe the excited-state PESs. When coupled to the simplified BL scheme considered in this study, it provides reliable description of the electronic relaxation in phenanthrene as compared with either the experimental data or the higher-level FSSH/TD-DFTB theoretical results. Furthermore, the DL performance allows high-throughput analysis at a negligible cost.},

  abstract = {Carbon materials and their unique properties have been extensively studied by molecular dynamics, thanks to the wide range of available carbon bond order potentials (CBOPs). Recently, with the increase in popularity of machine learning (ML), potentials such as Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), trained using ML, can accurately predict results for carbon. However, selecting the right potential is crucial as each performs differently for different carbon allotropes, and these differences can lead to inaccurate results. This work compares the widely used CBOPs and the GAP-20 ML potential with density functional theory results, including lattice constants, cohesive energies, defect formation energies, van der Waals interactions, thermal stabilities, and mechanical properties for different carbon allotropes. We find that GAP-20 can more accurately predict the structure, defect properties, and formation energies for a variety of crystalline phase carbon compared to CBOPs. Importantly, GAP-20 can simulate the thermal stability of C60 and the fracture of carbon nanotubes and graphene accurately, where CBOPs struggle. However, similar to CBOPs, GAP-20 is unable to accurately account for van der Waals interactions. Despite this, we find that GAP-20 outperforms all CBOPs assessed here and is at present the most suitable potential for studying thermal and mechanical properties for pristine and defective carbon.},

Since the limitation of quantum mechanics calculating resources, the interaction energy based on quantum mechanics can not be merged into molecular dynamic simulation for a long time scale. A deep learning framework, deep tensor neural network, is applied to predict the interaction energy of three organic related systems within the quantum mechanics level of accuracy. The geometric structure and atomic types of molecular conformation, as the data descriptors, are applied as the network inputs to predict the interaction energy in the system. The neural network is trained with the hierarchically generated conformations data set. The complex tensor hidden layers are simplified and trained in the optimization process. The predicted results of different molecular systems indicate that deep tensor neural network is capable to predict the interaction energy with 1 kcal/mol of the mean absolute error in a relatively short time. The prediction highly improves the efficiency of interaction energy calculation.

These features are highly descriptive, generalize to multiple chemical species, and are human-interpretable. The low-dimensional embeddings of each atomic environment can be used to understand and quantify messy crystal structures such as those near interfaces and defects or well-ordered crystal lattices such as in bulk materials without modification. The same method can also yield collective variables describing collections of particles such as for an entire simulation domain. I demonstrate the method on colloidal crystallization, ice crystals, and binary mesophases to illustrate its broad applicability. In each case, the learned latent space yields insights into the details of the observed microstructures. For ices and mesophases, supervised classifiers are trained based on the learned manifolds and directly compared against a recent neural-network-based approach. Notably, while this method provides comparable classification performance, it can also be deployed on even a handful of observed environments without labels or a priori knowledge. Thus, the current approach provides an incredibly versatile strategy to characterize and classify local atomic environments, and may unlock insights in a wide variety of molecular simulation contexts.},

To address this issue, we present a first-principles simulation-based approach for quantifying halogen bonds in molecular systems rooted in an understanding of nuclei-nuclei and electron-nuclei spatial correlations. We then demonstrate how this approach can be used to quantify the structure and dynamics of halogen bonds in condensed phases, using solid and liquid molecular chlorine as prototypical examples with high concentrations of halogen bonds.

  abstract = {Constrained by the fixed mathematical form of most empirical potentials used in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, many properties of materials cannot be captured within experimental accuracy. On the other hand, accurate electronic structure calculations based on quantum theory, most notably density functional theory (DFT), are limited to several hundred atoms within a picosecond, which makes the method inadequate for modeling systems beyond the nanoscale. A combination of speed from classical MD and fidelity from DFT can be achieved through machine learning methods. Herewith, we developed an approach named spatial density neural network force fields (SDNNFFs) by training neural networks to "learn" and predict DFT-level forces. Our model focuses on the usage of a three-dimensional mesh of density functions, which together act as a mapping of the atomic environment and provides a physical representation of the forces acting on the central atom. Several notable advantages arise from the SDNNFF, including (1) the avoidance of the chain rule on the total energy and other variables by direct calculation of the forces from the neural network, (2) the ever large N x t scaling of the training data, where N is the number of atoms in a supercell and t is the number of evaluated structures by first-principles, and (3) the significant reduction in parameters and human effort needed to successfully train a force- and/or property-converged neural network force field. Overall, we focus on modeling DFT-level forces with minimal computational cost and parametrization for rapid prediction of phonon-based properties and future molecular dynamics of large-scale systems. To demonstrate the SDNNFF, we trained several models on diamond structures, including bulk silicon (Si), diamond, silicon carbide (SiC), and boron arsenide (BAs), and predicted their phonon dispersions and lattice thermal conductivities using the direct solution to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. For phonon properties, we utilized a fitting method for obtaining the second-and third-order force constants, which outperforms the highly force-sensitive finite displacement method when employing neural network force fields. In comparison to DFT lattice thermal conductivity, we obtained high precision results from our SDNNFF within 0.7\% for Si, 6.2\% for diamond, 2.76\% for SiC, and 7.46\% for BAs, with further agreement with experiments. The phonon dispersions from the SDNNFF also matched those from direct DFT and experiments. The developed approach for accurately predicting phonon transport properties of crystalline materials would largely benefit the design of advanced materials with improved performance, such as complex thermoelectric devices and low thermal resistance interfaces for nanoelectronics. Future applications of our SDNNFF model could be extended toward including atomic energy into the algorithm and simulating large-scale heterogeneous systems for quasielectronic representations for various properties.},

  abstract = {Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causative factor of viral infection called COVID-19 that belongs to the zoonotic beta coronavirus family known to cause respiratory disorders or viral pneumonia, followed by an extensive attack on organs that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Human transmission of this virus occurs via respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which are released into the environment after sneezing or coughing. These droplets are capable of staying in the air as aerosols or surfaces and can be transmitted to persons through inhalation or contact with contaminated surfaces. Thus, there is an urgent need for advanced theranostic solutions to control the spread of COVID-19 infection. The development of such fit-for-purpose technologies hinges on a proper understanding of the transmission, incubation, and structural characteristics of the virus in the external environment and within the host. Hence, this article describes the development of an intrinsic model to describe the incubation characteristics of the virus under varying environmental factors. It also discusses on the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 structural nucleocapsid protein properties via computational approaches to generate high-affinity binding probes for effective diagnosis and targeted treatment applications by specific targeting of viruses. In addition, this article provides useful insights on the transmission behavior of the virus and creates new opportunities for theranostics development.},

  abstract = {Several pool-based active learning algorithms (AL) were employed to model potential energy surfaces (PESs) with a minimum number of electronic structure calculations. Theoretical and empirical results suggest that superior strategies can be obtained by sampling molecular structures corresponding to large uncertainties in their predictions while at the same time not deviating much from the true distribution of the data. To model PESs in an AL framework we propose to use a regression version of stochastic query by forest, a hybrid method that samples points corresponding to large uncertainties while avoiding collecting too many points from sparse regions of space. The algorithm is implemented with decision trees that come with relatively small computational costs. We empirically show that this algorithm requires around half the data to converge to the same accuracy in comparison to the uncertainty-based query-by-committee algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm is fully automatic and does not require any prior knowledge of the PES.

  abstract = {Molecular self-assembly is a powerful tool in materials design, wherein noncovalent interactions like electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals can be exploited to produce supramolecular nanostructures that are functional and highly tunable. Biomolecules are attractive building blocks, as they are biocompatible, biodegradable, and adopt a wide array of higher order structures. Moreover, naturally occurring protein systems display a manifold of structures and interactions that can be replicated in synthetic biomolecules. In this perspective, we highlight advances in multiscale simulation techniques across broad spatiotemporal scales that can aid in characterizing self-assembly of hybrid and hierarchical bionanomaterial systems, with an emphasis on physics-based simulation approaches currently employed to study biomolecules at mineral interfaces. The power of these approaches is highlighted across a few recent areas where molecular simulations have advanced our understanding of self-assembly spanning peptides to protein self-assembly. Looking forward, we discuss how in the near future emerging methods in statistical and machine learning will advance this research field in all areas from expanding the capabilities of physics-based simulation methods to enabling new analyses of high throughput experiments. These advances will pave the way for understanding the molecular recognition patterns in systems that are dictated by self-assembly-biomineralizing peptides, hierarchical peptoids, and large protein assemblies-and will aid in the development of a new synthesis science for achieving precise molecular control in materials design.},

  abstract = {Supervised machine learning is emerging as a powerful computational tool to predict the properties of complex quantum systems at a limited computational cost. In this article, we quantify how accurately deep neural networks can learn the properties of disordered quantum systems as a function of the system size. We implement a scalable convolutional network that can address arbitrary system sizes. This network is compared with a recently introduced extensive convolutional architecture [Mills, Chem. Sci. 10, 4129 (2019)2041-652010.1039/C8SC04578J] and with conventional dense networks with all-to-all connectivity. The networks are trained to predict the exact ground-state energies of various disordered systems, namely, a continuous-space single-particle Hamiltonian for cold-atoms in speckle disorder, and different setups of a quantum Ising chain with random couplings, including one with only short-range interactions and one augmented with a long-range term. In all testbeds we consider, the scalable network retains high accuracy as the system size increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the network scalability enables a transfer-learning protocol, whereby a pretraining performed on small systems drastically accelerates the learning of large-system properties, allowing reaching high accuracy with small training sets. In fact, with the scalable network one can even extrapolate to sizes larger than those included in the training set, accurately reproducing the results of state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations.}

This approach is able to accurately reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces from just a few 100s of molecular conformations extracted from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The data efficiency of the sGDML approach implies that atomic forces for these conformations can be computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the "gold standard" CCSD(T) method. We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML model recovers local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g. H-bonding, proton transfer, lone pairs, changes in hybridization states, steric repulsion and \$n\textbackslash to\textbackslash pi\^*\$ interactions) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML molecular dynamics trajectories yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy.},

Results are presented for model molecular liquids: pairwise Lennard-Jones, three-body Stillinger-Weber, and bottom-up coarse-graining of water. Here, covariant meshing proves to be an efficient strategy to learn canonically averaged instantaneous forces. We show that molecular dynamics simulations with tabulated two-and three-body ML potentials are computationally efficient and recover two-and three-body distribution functions.

We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science.

In this work, we adapt these concepts to interatomic potentials based on artificial neural networks. Instead of a single model, multiple models that share the same atomic environment descriptors yield an average that outperforms its individual members as well as a measure of the generalization error in the form of the committee disagreement. We not only use this disagreement to identify the most relevant configurations to build up the model's training set in an active learning procedure but also monitor and bias it during simulations to control the generalization error. This facilitates the adaptive development of committee neural network potentials and their training sets while keeping the number of ab initio calculations to a minimum. To illustrate the benefits of this methodology, we apply it to the development of a committee model for water in the condensed phase. Starting from a single reference ab initio simulation, we use active learning to expand into new state points and to describe the quantum nature of the nuclei. The final model, trained on 814 reference calculations, yields excellent results under a range of conditions, from liquid water at ambient and elevated temperatures and pressures to different phases of ice, and the air-water interface-all including nuclear quantum effects. This approach to committee models will enable the systematic development of robust machine learning models for a broad range of systems.},

Schran, J. Behler, and D. Marx, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 88 (2020)] is applied to the protonated water hexamer, H+(H2O)(6)-a system that the neural network has never seen before. Although being in the extrapolation regime, it is shown that the potential not only allows for quantum simulations from ultra-low temperatures similar to 1 K up to 300 K but is also able to describe the new system very accurately compared to explicit coupled cluster calculations. This transferability of the model is rationalized by the similarity of the atomic environments encountered for the larger cluster compared to the environments in the training set of the model. Compared to the interpolation regime, the quality of the model is reduced by roughly one order of magnitude, but most of the difference to the coupled cluster reference comes from global shifts of the potential energy surface, while local energy fluctuations are well recovered. These results suggest that the application of neural network potentials in extrapolation regimes can provide useful results and might be more general than usually thought.},

However, NN predictions are only reliable within well-learned training domains, and show volatile behavior when extrapolating. Uncertainty quantification approaches can flag atomic configurations for which prediction confidence is low, but arriving at such uncertain regions requires expensive sampling of the NN phase space, often using atomistic simulations. Here, we exploit automatic differentiation to drive atomistic systems towards high-likelihood, high-uncertainty configurations without the need for molecular dynamics simulations. By performing adversarial attacks on an uncertainty metric, informative geometries that expand the training domain of NNs are sampled. When combined to an active learning loop, this approach bootstraps and improves NN potentials while decreasing the number of calls to the ground truth method. This efficiency is demonstrated on sampling of kinetic barriers and collective variables in molecules, and can be extended to any NN potential architecture and materials system.},

Nevertheless, transferable force-fields with broad coverage of organic chemical space remain necessary for applications in materials and chemical discovery where throughput, consistency, and computational cost are paramount. Here we introduce a force-field development framework called Topology Automated Force-Field Interactions (TAFFI) for developing transferable force-fields of varying complexity against an extensible database of quantum chemistry calculations. TAFFI formalizes the concept of atom typing and makes it the basis for generating systematic training data that maintains a one-to-one correspondence with force-field terms. This feature makes TAFFI arbitrarily extensible to new chemistries while maintaining internal consistency and transferability. As a demonstration of TAFFI, we have developed a fixed-charge force-field, TAFFI-gen, from scratch that includes coverage for common organic functional groups that is comparable to established transferable force-fields. The performance of TAFFI-gen was benchmarked against OPLS and GAFF for reproducing several experimental proper- ties of 87 organic liquids. The consistent performance of these force-fields, despite their distinct origins, validates the TAFFI framework while also providing evidence of the representability limitations of fixed-charge force-fields.},

To this end, atomistic machine learning is a promising technology for bridging microscopic models and macroscopic phenomena. Here, we provide a timely snapshot of recent advances in this area.

  abstract = {Atomic neural networks (ANNs) constitute a class of machine learning methods for predicting potential energy surfaces and physicochemical properties of molecules and materials. Despite many successes, developing interpretable ANN architectures and implementing existing ones efficiently are still challenging. This calls for reliable, general-purpose, and open-source codes. Here, we present a python library named PiNN as a solution toward this goal. In PiNN, we designed a new interpretable and high-performing graph convolutional neural network variant, PiNet, as well as implemented the established Behler-Parrinello neural network. These implementations were tested using datasets of isolated small molecules, crystalline materials, liquid water, and an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. PiNN comes with a visualizer called PiNNBoard to extract chemical insight "learned" by ANNs. It provides analytical stress tensor calculations and interfaces to both the atomic simulation environment and a development version of the Amsterdam Modeling Suite. Moreover, PiNN is highly modularized, which makes it useful not only as a standalone package but also as a chain of tools to develop and to implement novel ANNs.

To reduce the smoothness requirement, the original problem is reformulated to a weak form so that the evaluations of high-order derivatives are avoided. Two neural networks, rather than just one, are employed to construct the approximate solution, with one network satisfying the essential boundary conditions and the other handling the rest part of the domain. In this way, an unconstrained optimization problem, instead of a constrained one, is solved without adding any penalty terms. The entanglement of the two networks is eliminated with the help of a length factor function that is scale invariant and can adapt with complex geometries. We prove the convergence of the PFNN method and conduct numerical experiments on a series of linear and nonlinear second-order boundary-value problems to demonstrate that PFNN is superior to several existing approaches in terms of accuracy, flexibility and robustness.

The key issue is how to deal with coherence and decoherence during the propagation of the two subsystems, which has been the subject of numerous investigations for a few decades. A brief description on Ehrenfest mean-field and surface-hopping (SH) methods is first provided, and then different algorithms for treatment of quantum decoherence are reviewed in the present paper. More attentions were paid to quantum trajectory meanfield (QTMF) method under the picture of quantum measurements, which is able to overcome the overcoherence problem. Furthermore, the combined QTMF and SH algorithm is proposed in the present work, which takes advantages of the QTMF and SH methods. The potential to extend the applicability of the QTMF method was briefly discussed, such as the generalization to other type of nonadiabatic transitions, the combination with multiscale computational models, and possible improvements on its accuracy and efficiency by using machine-learning techniques.},

As an unbiased optimization algorithm, the optimization process of genetic algorithm does not depend on the input structure and has strong global search capabilities.

Starting with introducing the standard genetic algorithm framework for global structure optimization, this review also includes the advanced framework developed by introducing parallel computing and machine learning technique.

Existing machine learning approaches usually first predict distances between atoms and then generate a 3D structure satisfying the distances, where noise in predicted distances may induce extra errors during 3D coordinate generation. Inspired by the traditional force field methods for molecular dynamics simulation, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called ConfGF by directly estimating the gradient fields of the log density of atomic coordinates. The estimated gradient fields allow directly generating stable conformations via Langevin dynamics. However, the problem is very challenging as the gradient fields are rototranslation equivariant. We notice that estimating the gradient fields of atomic coordinates can be translated to estimating the gradient fields of interatomic distances, and hence develop a novel algorithm based on recent score-based generative models to effectively estimate these gradients. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that ConfGF outperforms previous state-ofthe-art baselines by a significant margin.

The thermal conductivities calculated using different definitions of heat flux were compared, and the effect of explicit long-range Coulomb interaction on the conductivities was investigated. We clarified that using a rigorous heat flux formula for the ANN potential, even for highly ionic alpha-Ag2Se, the resulting thermal conductivity was reasonably consistent with the reference value without explicitly considering Coulomb interaction. It was found that ANN training including the virial term played an important role in reducing the dependency of thermal conductivity on the initial values of the weight parameters of the ANN.},

  abstract = {First-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations are highly accurate, but due to their high calculation cost, the computational scale is often limited to hundreds of atoms and few picoseconds under specific temperature and pressure conditions. We present here the guidelines for creating artificial neural network empirical interatomic potential (ANN potential) trained with such a limited FPMD data, which can perform long time scale MD simulations at least under the same conditions. The FPMD data for training are prepared on the basis of the convergence of radial distribution function [g(r)]. While training the ANN using total energy and atomic forces of the FPMD data, the error of pressure is also monitored and minimized. To create further robust potential, we add a small amount of FPMD data to reproduce the interaction between two atoms that are close to each other. ANN potentials for alpha-Ag2Se were created as an application example, and it has been confirmed that not only g(r) and mean square displacements but also the specific heat requiring a long time scale simulation matched the FPMD and the experimental values. In addition, the MD simulation using the ANN potential achieved over 10(4) acceleration over the FPMD one. The guidelines proposed here mitigate the creation difficulty of the ANN potential, and a lot of FPMD data sleeping on the hard disk after the research may be put on the front stage again.

In addition to advances in machine learning architectures and training techniques, achieving this ambitious goal requires a method to convert a 3D atomic system into a feature representation that preserves rotational and translational symmetries, smoothness under small perturbations, and invariance under re-ordering. The atomic orbital wavelet scattering transform preserves these symmetries by construction and has achieved great success as a featurization method for machine learning energy prediction. Both in small molecules and in the bulk amorphous Li alpha Si system, machine learning models using wavelet scattering coefficients as features have demonstrated a comparable accuracy to density functional theory at a small fraction of the computational cost. In this work, we test the generalizability of our Li alpha Si energy predictor to properties that were not included in the training set, such as elastic constants and migration barriers. We demonstrate that statistical feature selection methods can reduce over-fitting and lead to remarkable accuracy in these extrapolation tasks.},

In chemistry, ML has been used to develop models for predicting molecular properties, for example quantum mechanics (QM) calculated potential energy surfaces and atomic charge models. The ANI-1x and ANI-1ccx ML-based general-purpose potentials for organic molecules were developed through active learning; an automated data diversification process.

The ANI-1x data set contains multiple QM properties from 5\,M density functional theory calculations, while the ANI-1ccx data set contains 500\,k data points obtained with an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS extrapolation. Approximately 14 million CPU core-hours were expended to generate this data. Multiple QM calculated properties for the chemical elements C, H, N, and O are provided: energies, atomic forces, multipole moments, atomic charges, etc. We provide this data to the community to aid research and development of ML models for chemistry.},

  abstract = {Interatomic potentials are essential for studying fundamental mechanisms of deformation and failure in metals and alloys because the relevant defects (dislocations, cracks, etc.) are far above the scales accessible to first-principles studies. Existing potentials for non-fcc metals and nearly all alloys are, however, not sufficiently quantitative for many crucial phenomena. Here machine learning in the Behler-Parrinello neural-network framework is used to create a broadly applicable potential for pure hcp magnesium (Mg). Lightweight Mg and its alloys are technologically important while presenting a diverse range of slip systems and crystal surfaces relevant to both plasticity and fracture that present a significant challenge for any potential. The machine learning potential is trained on first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) computable metallurgically relevant properties and is then shown to well predict metallurgically crucial dislocation and crack structures and competing phenomena. Extensive comparisons to an existing very good modified embedded atom method potential are made. These results demonstrate that a single machine learning potential can represent the wide scope of phenomena required for metallurgical studies. The DFT database is openly available for use in any other machine learning method. The method is naturally extendable to alloys, which are necessary for engineering applications but where ductility and fracture are controlled by complex atomic-scale mechanisms that are not well predicted by existing potentials.}

Prospective applications on exascale computers are also briefly discussed and commented on, with reference to two specific examples of soft mesoscale materials: microfluid crystals and bi-continuous jels. 2. Introduction Complex fluid-interface dynamics [1, 2, 3, 4], disordered liquid-liquid emulsions [5, 6], soft-flowing microfluidic crystals [7, 8, 9, 10], all stand as complex states of matter which, besides raising new challenges to modern non-equilibrium thermodynamics, pave the way to many engineering applications, such as combustion and food processing [11, 12], as well as to questions in fundamental biological and physiological processes, like blood flows and protein dynamics [13]. In particular this novel state of soft matter opens up exciting prospects for the design of new materials whose effective building blocks are droplets instead of molecules [14, 7, 15, 16]. The design of new materials has traditionally provided a relentless stimulus to the development of computational schemes spanning the full spectrum of scales, from electrons to atoms and molecules, to supramolecular structures all the way up to the continuum, encompassing over ten decades in space (say from Angstroms to meters) and at least fifteen in time (from femtoseconds to seconds, just to fix ideas). Of course, no single computational model can handle such huge spectrum of scales, each region being treated by dedicated and suitable methods, such as electronic structure simulations, ab-initio molecular dynamics, classical molecular dynamics, stochastic methods, lattice kinetic},

We use probabilistic modeling based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We illustrate that it is possible to build an accurate GP model of a 51-dimensional PES based on 5000 randomly distributed ab initio calculations with a global accuracy of {$<$}0.2 kcal/mol. Our approach uses GP models with composite kernels designed to enhance the Bayesian information content and represents the global PES as a sum of a full-dimensional GP and several GP models for molecular fragments of lower dimensionality. We demonstrate the potency of these algorithms by constructing the global PES for the protonated imidazole dimer, a molecular system with 19 atoms. We illustrate that GP models thus constructed can extrapolate the PES from low energies ({$<$}10 000 cm(-1)), yielding a PES at high energies ({$>$}20 000 cm(-1)). This opens the prospect for new applications of GPs, such as mapping out phase transitions by extrapolation or accelerating Bayesian optimization, for high-dimensional physics and chemistry problems with a restricted number of inputs, i.e., for high-dimensional problems where obtaining training data is very difficult.},

  abstract = {A universal interatomic potential applicable to arbitrary elements and structures is urgently needed in computational materials science. Graph convolution-based neural network is a promising approach by virtue of its ability to express complex relations. Thus far, it has been thought to represent a completely different approach from physics-based interatomic potentials. In this paper, we show that these two methods can be regarded as different representations of the same tight-binding electronic relaxation framework, where atom-based and overlap integral or "bond"-based Hamiltonian information are propagated in a directional fashion. Based on this unified view, we propose a new model, named the tensor embedded atom network (TeaNet), where the stacked network model is associated with the electronic total energy relaxation calculation. Furthermore, Tersoff-style angular interaction is translated into graph convolution architecture through the incorporation of Euclidean tensor values. Our model can represent and transfer spatial information. TeaNet shows great performance in both the robustness of interatomic potentials and the expressive power of neural networks. We demonstrate that arbitrary chemistry involving the first 18 elements on the periodic table (H to Ar) can be realized by our model, including C-H molecular structures, metals, amorphous SiO\$\{\}\_2\$, and water.},

It is assumed that the atomic energy is represented by the linear regression of the atomic structural descriptor. The atomic energy is obtained through DFT calculations using a small cell extracted from a huge GB model, called replica DFT atomic energy. The uncertainty reduction (UR) approach in active learning is used to efficiently collect the training data for the atomic energy. In this approach, atomic energy is not required to search for candidate points; therefore, sequential DFT calculations are not required. This approach is suitable for massively parallel computers that can execute a large number of jobs simultaneously. In this study, we demonstrate the prediction of the atomic energy of a Fe random GB model containing one million atoms using the UR approach, and we show that the prediction error decreases more rapidly compared with random sampling. We conclude that the UR approach with replica DFT atomic energy is useful for modeling huge GBs and will be essential for modeling other structural defects.}

However, in practice, power series are not easy to compute. In this paper, we propose a new and more stable way to construct deep RePU neural networks based on Chebyshev polynomial approximations. By using a hierarchical structure of Chebyshev polynomial approximation in frequency domain, we build efficient and stable deep neural network constructions. In theory, ChebNets and the deep RePU nets based on Power series have the same upper error bounds for general function approximations. But numerically, ChebNets are much more stable. Numerical results show that the constructed ChebNets can be further trained and obtain much better results than those obtained by training deep RePU nets constructed basing on power series.},

We show that the obtained DNN model can well reproduce the energies and forces calculated by AIMD simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the DNN interatomic potential also accurately describe the structural properties of the Al(90)Tb(10)liquid, such as partial pair correlation functions (PPCFs) and bond angle distributions, in comparison with the results from AIMD simulations. Furthermore, the developed DNN interatomic potential predicts the formation energies of the crystalline phases of the Al-Tb system with an accuracy comparable toab initiocalculations. The structure factors of the Al(90)Tb(10)metallic liquid and glass obtained by MD simulations using the developed DNN interatomic potential are also in good agreement with the experimental X-ray diffraction data.

We show that more than 80\% of the Tb-centered clusters in Al90Tb10 glass have short-range order (SRO) with their 17 first coordination shell atoms stacked in a '3661' or '15551' sequence. Medium-range order (MRO) in Bergman-type packing extended out to the second and third coordination shells is also clearly observed. Analysis of the network formed by the '3661' and '15551' clusters show that similar to 82\% of such SRO units share their faces or vertexes, while only similar to 6\% of neighboring SRO pairs are interpenetrating. Such a network topology is consistent with the Bergman-type MRO around the Tb-centers. Moreover, crystal structure searches using genetic algorithm and the neural network interatomic potential reveal several low-energy metastable crystalline structures in the composition range close to Al90Tb10. Some of these crystalline structures have the '3661' SRO while others have the '15551' SRO. While the crystalline structures with the '3661' SRO also exhibit the MRO very similar to that observed in the glass, the ones with the '15551' SRO have very different atomic packing in the second and third shells around the Tb centers from that of the Bergman-type MRO observed in the glassy phase.

However, its methodology development has been struggling with a tradeoff between accuracy/resolution and speed, significant improvement of both beyond present state of the art is necessary to reliably substitute many expensive and laborious experiments in molecular biology, materials science and nanotechnology. Previously, the ubiquitous issue regarding severe wasting of computational resources in all forms of molecular simulations due to repetitive local sampling was raised, and the local free energy landscape approach was proposed to address it. This approach is derived from a simple idea of first learning local distributions, and followed by dynamic assembly of which to infer global joint distribution of a target molecular system. When compared with conventional explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, a simple and approximate implementation of this theory in protein structural refinement harvested acceleration of about six orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy. While this initial test revealed tremendous benefits for addressing repetitive local sampling, there are some implicit assumptions need to be articulated. Here, I present a more thorough discussion of repetitive local sampling; potential options for learning local distributions; a more general formulation with potential extension to simulation of near equilibrium molecular systems; the prospect of developing computation driven molecular science; the connection to mainstream residue pair distance distribution based protein structure prediction/refinement; and the fundamental difference of utilizing averaging from conventional molecular simulation framework based on potential of mean force. This more general development is termed the local distribution theory to release the limitation of strict thermodynamic equilibrium in its potential wide application in general soft condensed molecular systems.},

To do so, we focus on a central problem in biology: predicting how proteins interact with one another—that is, which surfaces of one protein bind to which surfaces of another protein. We present Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet), the first end-to-end learning method for protein interface prediction. Despite using only spatial coordinates and identities of atoms as inputs, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely on hand-engineered, high-level features. These results are particularly striking because we train the method entirely on a significantly biased data set that does not account for the fact that proteins deform when binding to one another. Demonstrating the first successful application of transfer learning to atomic-level data, our network maintains high performance, without retraining, when tested on real cases in which proteins do deform.},

  abstract = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in computational chemistry. After being trained on appropriate ab initio reference data, these methods allow for accurately predicting the properties of chemical systems, circumventing the need for explicitly solving the electronic Schrodinger equation. Because of their computational efficiency and scalability to large data sets, deep neural networks (DNNs) are a particularly promising ML algorithm for chemical applications. This work introduces PhysNet, a DNN architecture designed for predicting energies, forces, and dipole moments of chemical systems. PhysNet achieves stateof-the-art performance on the QM9, MD17, and ISO17 benchmarks. Further, two new data sets are generated in order to probe the performance of ML models for describing chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and condensed phase systems. It is shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a potential energy surface (PES). PhysNet models trained on a systematically constructed set of small peptide fragments (at most eight heavy atoms) are able to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine (Ala(10)): The optimized geometry of helical Ala10 predicted by PhysNet is virtually identical to ab initio results (RMSD = 0.21 A). By running unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ala(10) on the PhysNet-PES in gas phase, it is found that instead of a helical structure, Ala(10) folds into a "wreath-shaped" configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46 kcal mol(-1) according to the reference ab initio calculations.},

This work introduces SpookyNet, a deep neural network for constructing ML-FFs with explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom and quantum nonlocality. Chemically meaningful inductive biases and analytical corrections built into the network architecture allow it to properly model physical limits. SpookyNet improves upon the current state-of-the-art (or achieves similar performance) on popular quantum chemistry data sets. Notably, it is able to generalize across chemical and conformational space and can leverage the learned chemical insights, e.g. by predicting unknown spin states, thus helping to close a further important remaining gap for today's machine learning models in quantum chemistry.},

Here, we introduce FLARE++, a Bayesian active learning method for training reactive many-body force fields "on the fly" during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. During the automated training loop, the predictive uncertainties of a sparse Gaussian process (SGP) force field are evaluated at each timestep of an MD simulation to determine whether additional ab initio data are needed. Once trained, the SGP is mapped onto an equivalent and much faster model that is polynomial in the local environment descriptors and whose prediction cost is independent of the training set size. We apply our method to a canonical reactive system in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, hydrogen splitting and recombination on a platinum (111) surface, obtaining a trained model within three days of wall time that is twice as fast as a recent Pt/H ReaxFF force field and considerably more accurate. Our method is fully open source and is expected to reduce the time and effort required to train fast and accurate reactive force fields for complex systems.},

  abstract = {Dynamics of flexible molecules are often determined by an interplay between local chemical bond fluctuations and conformational changes driven by long-range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. This interplay between interactions yields complex potential-energy surfaces (PESs) with multiple minima and transition paths between them. In this work, we assess the performance of the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models, namely, sGDML, SchNet, Gaussian Approximation Potentials/Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (GAPs/SOAPs), and Behler-Parrinello neural networks, for reproducing such PESs, while using limited amounts of reference data. As a benchmark, we use the cis to trans thermal relaxation in an azobenzene molecule, where at least three different transition mechanisms should be considered. Although GAP/SOAP, SchNet, and sGDML models can globally achieve a chemical accuracy of 1 kcal mol(-1) with fewer than 1000 training points, predictions greatly depend on the ML method used and on the local region of the PES being sampled. Within a given ML method, large differences can be found between predictions of close-to-equilibrium and transition regions, as well as for different transition mechanisms. We identify key challenges that the ML models face mainly due to the intrinsic limitations of commonly used atom-based descriptors. All in all, our results suggest switching from learning the entire PES within a single model to using multiple local models with optimized descriptors, training sets, and architectures for different parts of the complex PES.},

The methodology relies on Bayesian inference and machine learning techniques to construct a stochastic PES and to express the inadequacies associated with the ab initio data points and their fit. By combining high fidelity calculations and reduced-order modeling, the resulting stochastic surface is efficiently forward propagated via quasi-classical trajectory and master equation calculations. In this way, the PES contribution to the uncertainty on predefined quantities of interest (QoIs) is explicitly determined. This study is done at both microscopic (e.g., rovibrational-specific rate coefficients) and macroscopic (e.g., thermal and chemical relaxation properties) levels. A correlation analysis is finally applied to identify the PES regions that require further refinement, based on their effects on the QoI reliability. The methodology is applied to the study of singlet (11A′) and quintet (25A′) PESs describing the interaction between O2 molecules and O atoms in their ground electronic state. The investigation of the singlet surface reveals a negligible uncertainty on the kinetic properties and relaxation times, which are found to be in excellent agreement with the ones previously published in the literature. On the other hand, the methodology demonstrated significant uncertainty on the quintet surface, due to inaccuracies in the description of the exchange barrier and the repulsive wall. When forward propagated, this uncertainty is responsible for the variability of 1 order of magnitude in the vibrational relaxation time and of factor four in the exchange reaction rate coefficient, both at 2500 K.}

In this study, an extensible generalized molecular fractionation with a conjugate caps method combined with neural networks (NN-GMFCC) is developed for efficient QM calculation of protein energy. In the NN-GMFCC scheme, the total energy of a given protein is calculated by taking a proper combination of the high-precision neural network potential energies of all capped residues and overlapping conjugate caps. In addition, the two-body interaction energies of residue pairs are calculated by molecular mechanics (MM). With reference to the GMFCC/MM calculation at the.B97XD/6-31G* level, the overall mean unsigned errors of the energy deviations and atomic force root-mean-squared errors calculated by NN-GMFCC are only 2.01 kcal/mol and 0.68 kcal/mol/A, respectively, for 14 proteins (containing up to 13,728 atoms). Meanwhile, the NN-GMFCC approach is about 4 orders of magnitude faster than the GMFCC/MM method. The NN-GMFCC method could be systematically improved by inclusion of two-body QM interaction and multibody electronic polarization effect. Moreover, the NN-GMFCC approach can also be applied to other macromolecular systems such as DNA/RNA, and it is capable of providing a powerful and efficient approach for exploration of structures and functions of proteins with QM accuracy.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations use statistical mechanics at the atomistic scale to enable both the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms and the engineering of matter for desired tasks. The behavior of molecular systems at the microscale is typically simulated with differential equations parameterized by a Hamiltonian, or energy function. The Hamiltonian describes the state of the system and its interactions with the environment. In order to derive predictive microscopic models, one wishes to infer a molecular Hamiltonian that agrees with observed macroscopic quantities. From the perspective of engineering, one wishes to control the Hamiltonian to achieve desired simulation outcomes and structures, as in self-assembly and optical control, to then realize systems with the desired Hamiltonian in the lab. In both cases, the goal is to modify the Hamiltonian such that emergent properties of the simulated system match a given target. We demonstrate how this can be achieved using differentiable simulations where bulk target observables and simulation outcomes can be analytically differentiated with respect to Hamiltonians, opening up new routes for parameterizing Hamiltonians to infer macroscopic models and develop control protocols.},

  abstract = {Atomic diffusion is a spontaneous process and significantly influences properties of materials, such as fracture toughness, creep-fatigue properties, thermal conductivity, thermoelectric properties, etc. Here, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on both ab initio and machine-learning potentials, we demonstrate that an atomic one dimensional cooperative diffusion exists in the simple cubic high-pressure finite-temperature phase of calcium in the premelting regime, where some atoms diffuse cooperatively as chains or even rings, while others remain in the solid state. This intermediate regime is triggered by anharmonicity of the system at high temperature and is stabilized by the competition between the internal energy minimization and the entropy maximization, and has close connections with the unique electronic structures of simple cubic Ca as an electride with a pseudogap. This cooperative diffusion regime explains the abnormal enhancement of the melting line of Ca under high pressure and suggests that the cooperative chain melting is a much more common high-temperature feature among metals under extreme conditions than hitherto thought. The microscopic electronic investigations of these systems combining ab initio and machine-learning data point out the direction for further understanding of other metallic systems such as the glass transition, liquid metals, etc.},

  abstract = {Gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) is an accurate and efficient approach to learn a molecular potential and associated force field based on the kernel ridge regression algorithm. Here, we demonstrate its application to learn an effective coarse-grained (CG) model from all-atom simulation data in a sample efficient manner. The CG force field is learned by following the thermodynamic consistency principle, here by minimizing the error between the predicted CG force and the all-atom mean force in the CG coordinates. Solving this problem by GDML directly is impossible because coarse-graining requires averaging over many training data points, resulting in impractical memory requirements for storing the kernel matrices. In this work, we propose a data-efficient and memory-saving alternative. Using ensemble learning and stratified sampling, we propose a 2-layer training scheme that enables GDML to learn an effective CG model. We illustrate our method on a simple biomolecular system, alanine dipeptide, by reconstructing the free energy landscape of a CG variant of this molecule. Our novel GDML training scheme yields a smaller free energy error than neural networks when the training set is small, and a comparably high accuracy when the training set is sufficiently large.},

  abstract = {An accurate force field is the key to the success of all molecular mechanics simulations on organic polymers and biomolecules. Accuracy beyond density functional theory is often needed to describe the intermolecular interactions, while most correlated wavefunction (CW) methods are prohibitively expensive for large molecules. Therefore, it posts a great challenge to develop an extendible ab initio force field for large flexible organic molecules at CW level of accuracy. In this work, we face this challenge by combining the physics-driven nonbonding potential with a data-driven subgraph neural network bonding model (named sGNN). Tests on polyethylene glycol polymer chains show that our strategy is highly accurate and robust for molecules of different sizes. Therefore, we can develop the force field from small molecular fragments (with sizes easily accessible to CW methods) and safely transfer it to large polymers, thus opening a new path to the next-generation organic force fields.},

  abstract = {Atomistic or ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to predict thermodynamics and kinetics and relate them to molecular structure. A common approach to go beyond the time- and length-scales accessible with such computationally expensive simulations is the definition of coarse-grained molecular models. Existing coarse-graining approaches define an effective interaction potential to match defined properties of high-resolution models or experimental data. In this paper, we reformulate coarse-graining as a supervised machine learning problem. We use statistical learning theory to decompose the coarse-graining error and cross-validation to select and compare the performance of different models. We introduce CGnets, a deep learning approach, that learns coarse-grained free energy functions and can be trained by a force-matching scheme. CGnets maintain all physically relevant invariances and allow one to incorporate prior physics knowledge to avoid sampling of unphysical structures. We show that CGnets can capture all-atom explicit-solvent free energy surfaces with models using only a few coarse-grained beads and no solvent, while classical coarse-graining methods fail to capture crucial features of the free energy surface. Thus, CGnets are able to capture multibody terms that emerge from the dimensionality reduction.},

By reducing the number of degrees of freedom, a CG model can explore long time- and length-scales inaccessible to computational models at higher resolution. If a CG model is designed by formally integrating out some of the system's degrees of freedom, one expects multi-body interactions to emerge in the effective CG model's energy function. In practice, it has been shown that the inclusion of multi-body terms indeed improves the accuracy of a CG model. However, no general approach has been proposed to systematically construct a CG effective energy that includes arbitrary orders of multi-body terms. In this work, we propose a neural network based approach to address this point and construct a CG model as a multi-body expansion. By applying this approach to a small protein, we evaluate the relative importance of the different multi-body terms in the definition of an accurate model. We observe a slow convergence in the multi-body expansion, where up to five-body interactions are needed to reproduce the free energy of an atomistic model.},

  abstract = {Accurately evaluating the adsorption ability of adsorbents for heavy metal ions (HMIs) and organic pollutants in water is critical for the design and preparation of emerging highly efficient adsorbents. However, predicting adsorption capabilities of adsorbents at arbitrary sites is challenging, with currently unavailable measuring technology for active sites and the corresponding activities. Here, we present an efficient artificial intelligence (AI) approach to predict the adsorption ability of adsorbents at arbitrary sites, as a case study of three HMIs (Pb(II), Hg(II), and Cd(II)) adsorbed on the surface of a representative two-dimensional graphitic-C3N4. We apply the deep neural network and transfer learning to predict the adsorption capabilities of three HMIs at arbitrary sites, with the predicted results of Cd(II){$>$}Hg(II){$>$}Pb(II) and the root-mean-squared errors less than 0.1eV. The proposed AI method has the same prediction accuracy as the ab initio DFT calculation, but is millions of times faster than the DFT to predict adsorption abilities at arbitrary sites and only requires one-tenth of datasets compared to training from scratch. We further verify the adsorption capacity of g-C3N4 towards HMIs experimentally and obtain results consistent with the AI prediction. It indicates that the presented approach is capable of evaluating the adsorption ability of adsorbents efficiently, and can be further extended to other interdisciplines and industries for the adsorption of harmful elements in aqueous solution.},

In this work, we develop a symmetry-adapted graph neural networks framework, named molecular dynamics graph neural networks (MDGNN), to construct force fields automatically for molecular dynamics simulations for both molecules and crystals. This architecture consistently preserves the translation, rotation and permutation invariance in the simulations. We propose a new feature engineering method including higher order contributions and show that MDGNN accurately reproduces the results of both classical and first-principles molecular dynamics. We also demonstrate that force fields constructed by the model has good transferability. Therefore, MDGNN provides an efficient and promising option for molecular dynamics simulations of large scale systems with high accuracy.},

We show that the generated ML potential captures the structural features and motifs in Pd82Si18 and Pd75Si25 liquids more accurately than the existing interatomic potential based on embedded-atom method (EAM). The ML potential also describes the solid-liquid interface of these systems very well. Moreover, while the existing EAM potential fails to describe the relative energies of various crystalline structures and predict wrong ground-state structures at Pd3Si and Pd9Si2 composition, the developed ML potential predicts correctly the ground-state structures from genetic algorithm search.

  abstract = {The applications of machine learning techniques to chemistry and materials science become more numerous by the day. The main challenge is to devise representations of atomic systems that are at the same complete and concise, so as to reduce the number of reference calculations that are needed to predict the properties of different types of materials reliably. This has led to a proliferation of alternative ways to convert an atomic structure into an input for a machine-learning model. We introduce an abstract definition of chemical environments that is based on a smoothed atomic density, using a bra-ket notation to emphasize basis set independence and to highlight the connections with some popular choices of representations for describing atomic systems. The correlations between the spatial distribution of atoms and their chemical identities are computed as inner products between these feature kets, which can be given an explicit representation in terms of the expansion of the atom density on orthogonal basis functions, that is equivalent to the smooth overlap of atomic positions power spectrum, but also in real space, corresponding to n-body correlations of the atom density. This formalism lays the foundations for a more systematic tuning of the behavior of the representations, by introducing operators that represent the correlations between structure, composition, and the target properties. It provides a unifying picture of recent developments in the field and indicates a way forward toward more effective and computationally affordable machine-learning schemes for molecules and materials.

  abstract = {Machine-learning of atomic-scale properties amounts to extracting correlations between structure, composition and the quantity that one wants to predict. Representing the input structure in a way that best reflects such correlations makes it possible to improve the accuracy of the model for a given amount of reference data. When using a description of the structures that is transparent and well-principled, optimizing the representation might reveal insights into the chemistry of the data set. Here we show how one can generalize the SOAP kernel to introduce a distance-dependent weight that accounts for the multi-scale nature of the interactions, and a description of correlations between chemical species. We show that this improves substantially the performance of ML models of molecular and materials stability, while making it easier to work with complex, multi-component systems and to extend SOAP to coarse-grained intermolecular potentials. The element correlations that give the best performing model show striking similarities with the conventional periodic table of the elements, providing an inspiring example of how machine learning can rediscover, and generalize, intuitive concepts that constitute the foundations of chemistry.},

  abstract = {Free energy perturbation (FEP) was proposed by Zwanzig [J. Chem. Phys. 22, 1420 (1954)] more than six decades ago as a method to estimate free energy differences and has since inspired a huge body of related methods that use it as an integral building block. Being an importance sampling based estimator, however, FEP suffers from a severe limitation: the requirement of sufficient overlap between distributions. One strategy to mitigate this problem, called Targeted FEP, uses a high-dimensional mapping in configuration space to increase the overlap of the underlying distributions. Despite its potential, this method has attracted only limited attention due to the formidable challenge of formulating a tractable mapping. Here, we cast Targeted FEP as a machine learning problem in which the mapping is parameterized as a neural network that is optimized so as to increase the overlap. We develop a new model architecture that respects permutational and periodic symmetries often encountered in atomistic simulations and test our method on a fully periodic solvation system. We demonstrate that our method leads to a substantial variance reduction in free energy estimates when compared against baselines, without requiring any additional data.},

As a demonstration example, we apply our method to control evaporative cooling experiments in cold atoms. We have first tested our method with simulated data and then applied our method to real experiments.

  abstract = {The discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films opens up new opportunities for using this silicon-compatible ferroelectric to realize low-power logic circuits and high-density nonvolatile memories. The functional performances of ferroelectrics are intimately related to their dynamic responses to external stimuli such as electric fields at finite temperatures. Molecular dynamics is an ideal technique for investigating dynamical processes on large length and time scales, though its applications to new materials are often hindered by the limited availability and accuracy of classical force fields. Here we present a deep neural network-based interatomic force field of HfO2 learned from ab initio data using a concurrent learning procedure. The model potential is able to predict structural properties such as elastic constants, equation of states, phonon dispersion relationships, and phase transition barriers of various hafnia polymorphs with accuracy comparable with density functional theory calculations. The validity of this model potential is further confirmed by the reproduction of experimental sequences of temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions of HfO2 with isobaric-isothermal ensemble molecular dynamics simulations. We suggest a general approach to extend the model potential of HfO(2 )to related material systems including dopants and defects.},

  abstract = {Interatomic potential plays a key role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of molecular-dynamics simulation results. While most empirical potentials are benchmarked against a set of carefully chosen bulk material properties, recent advances in machine learning have seen the emergence of neural-network-based mathematical potentials capable of describing highly complex potential energy surfaces for a variety of systems. We report here the development of a neural-network interatomic potential (NNIP) with modified embedded-atom method background density as fingerprint functions, which could accurately model the energetics of metallic nanoparticles and clusters (Cu as a representative example) widely used in catalysis. To appropriately account for the diverse chemical environments encountered in nanoparticles/nanoclusters, an extensive set of atomic configurations (totaling 18 084) were calculated using density-functional-theory (DFT) at the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof level. In addition to standard bulk properties such as cohesive energies and elastic constants, the sampled configurations also include a substantial number of differently oriented crystal facets and differently sized nanoparticles and nanoclusters, greatly expanding the value range of NNIP features that was otherwise quite limited. The complex energy potential surface of Cu can be faithfully reproduced, with an average error of 0.011 eV/at for energy states within 3 eV of the ground state. As an illustration, the developed NNIP is used to simulate the molecular dynamics of copper nanoparticles, and good agreement is achieved between DFT and the NNIP.},

  abstract = {Thermal transport phenomena are ubiquitous and play a critical role in the performance of various microelectronic and energy-conversion devices. Binary rocksalt and zinc blende compounds, despite their rather simple crystal structures, exhibit an extraordinary range of lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(L)) spanning over 3 orders of magnitude. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying heat transfer mechanism through the development of microscopic theories is therefore of fundamental importance, yet it remains elusive because of the challenges arising from explicitly treating higher-order anharmonicity. Recent theoretical and experimental advances have revealed the essential role of quartic anharmonicity in suppressing heat transfer in zinc blende boron arsenide (BAs) with ultrahigh kappa(L). However, critical questions concerning the general effects of higher-order anharmonicity in the broad classes and chemistries of binary solids are still unanswered. Using our recently developed high-throughput phonon framework based on first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of 37 binary compounds with rocksalt and zinc blende structures at room temperature, with a particular focus on unraveling the impacts of quartic anharmonicity on kappa(L). Our advanced theoretical model for computing kappa(L) embraces current state-of-the-art methods, featuring a complete treatment of quartic anharmonicity for both phonon frequencies and lifetimes at finite temperatures, as well as contributions from off-diagonal terms in the heat-flux operator. We find the impacts of quartic anharmonicity on kappa(L) to be strikingly different in rocksalt and zinc blende compounds, owing to the countervailing effects on finite-temperature-induced shifts in phonon frequencies and scattering rates. By correlating.L with the phonon scattering phase space, we outline a qualitative but efficient route to assess the importance of four-phonon scattering from harmonic phonon calculations. Among notable examples, in zinc blende HgTe, we identify an unprecedented sixfold reduction in kappa(L) due to four-phonon scattering, which dominates over the three-phonon scattering in the acoustic region at room temperature. We also demonstrate a possible breakdown of the phonon gas model in rocksalt AgCl, wherein the phonon states are significantly broadened due to strong intrinsic anharmonicity, inducing off-diagonal contributions to kappa(L) comparable to the diagonal ones. The deep physical insights gained in this work can be used to guide the rational design of thermal management materials.},

Using this approach, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the stability of the stanene monolayer.

We show that important dynamical information, which would be difficult to obtain otherwise, can be learned for various multi-component amorphous material systems.

In this work, an ESOINN-DP method is developed, which has the enhanced self-organizing incremental neuralnetwork (ESOINN) and a newly proposed error indicator at its core. With ESOINN-DP, One can construct the NNPES with little human intervention, and this method ensures that the constructed reference dataset covers the target chemical space with minimum redundancy. The performance of the ESOINN-DP method has been well validated by developing neural network potential energy surfaces for water clusters and by de-redundancy of a sub-data set of the ANI1 database. We believe that the ESOINN-DP method provides a novelty idea for the construction of NNPES and especially, the reference datasets, and it can be used for MD simulations of various gas-phase and condensed-phase chemical systems.},

Li-Si systems play an important role in the development of high-energy lithium ion batteries. One challenge in simulating Li-Si systems is to balance the proper description of complex Li-Si interactions and the system size. Molecular simulations implemented with DP provide a promising alternative to achieve this balance and enable us to investigate the fine details of Li-Si systems that the classical force fields cannot offer. We develop a DP for Li-Si systems with Li/Si ratio ranging from 0 to 4.2 based on a vast data set generated using the quantum mechanical calculations in an active learning procedure. Then we investigate the structural and dynamic properties of several crystalline and amorphous Li-Si systems using this developed DP. The DP can predict bulk densities, the radial distribution functions, and diffusivity of Li in amorphous Li-Si systems with an accuracy close to quantum mechanical calculations with the benefit of 20 times faster speed than the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Several issues related to the development of DP are also discussed.},

Because of the lighter mass of hydrogen than deuteron, the properties of light water are more influenced by nuclear quantum effect than those of heavy water. Clear isotope effects are observed and analyzed in terms of hydrogen-bond structure and electronic properties of water that are closely associated with experimental observables. The molecular structures of both liquid H2O and D2O agree well with the data extracted from scattering experiments. The delicate isotope effects on radial distribution functions and angular distribution functions are well reproduced as well.

  abstract = {An artificial neural network provides the possibility to develop molecular potentials with both the efficiency of the classical molecular mechanics and the accuracy of the quantum chemical methods. Here, we develop an ab initio based neural network potential (NN/MM-RESP) to perform molecular dynamics study of zinc ion in liquid water. In this approach, the interaction energy, atomic forces, and atomic charges of zinc ion and water molecules' in the first solvent shell are described by a neural network potential trained with energies and forces generated from density functional calculations. The predicted energies and forces from the NN potential show excellent agreement with the quantum chemistry calculations. Using this approach, we carried out molecular dynamics simulation to study the hydration of zinc ion in water. The experimentally observed zinc-water radial distribution function, as well as the X-ray absorption near edge structure spectrum, is well-reproduced by the MD simulation. Comparison of the results with other theoretical calculations is provided, and important features of the present approach are discussed. The neural network approach used in this study can be applied to construct potentials to study solvation of other metal ions, and its salient features can shed light on the development of more accurate molecular potentials for metal ions in other environments such as proteins.},

  abstract = {De novo molecule design through molecular generative model is gaining increasing attention in recent years. Here a novel generative model was proposed by integrating the 3D structural information of the protein binding pocket into the conditional RNN (cRNN) model to control the generation of drug-like molecules. In this model, the composition of protein binding pocket is effectively characterized through a coarse-grain strategy and the threedimensional information of the pocket can be represented by the sorted eigenvalues of the coulomb matrix (EGCM) of the coarse-grained atoms composing the binding pocket. In current work, we used our EGCM method and a previously reported binding pocket descriptor DeeplyTough to train cRNN models and compared their performance. It has been shown that the molecules generated with the control of protein environment information have a clear tendency on generating compounds with higher similarity to the original X-ray bound ligand than normal RNN model and also achieving better performance in terms of docking scores. Our results demonstrate the potential application of EGCM controlled generative model for the targeted molecule generation and guided exploration on the drug-like chemical space.},

One challenge in developing machine learning potential is how to construct a data set with low sample redundancy. This work investigates the method to optimize the training data set while maintaining the desirable accuracy of the machine learning potential using the structural similarity algorithm. We construct several subsets ranging from 200-1500 sample configurations by selecting representative configurations from a 6183-sample data set using the farthest point sampling method and examine the ability of the machine learning potential trained from the subsets to predict energy, atomic forces and structural properties of Li-Si systems. The simulation results show that the potential developed from 400 configurations can be as accurate as the one developed from the 6183-sample data set. In addition, our computation results highlight that the structure-comparison algorithms can not only effectively remove redundant from training sets, but also achieve an appropriate distribution of samples in training data sets.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous catalysis plays a significant role in the modern chemical industry. Towards the rational design of novel catalysts, understanding reactions over surfaces is the most essential aspect. Typical industrial catalytic processes such as syngas conversion and methane utilisation can generate a large reaction network comprising thousands of intermediates and reaction pairs. This complexity not only arises from the permutation of transformations between species but also from the extra reaction channels offered by distinct surface sites. Despite the success in investigating surface reactions at the atomic scale, the huge computational expense of ab initio methods hinders the exploration of such complicated reaction networks. With the proliferation of catalysis studies, machine learning as an emerging tool can take advantage of the accumulated reaction data to emulate the output of ab initio methods towards swift reaction prediction. Here, we briefly summarise the conventional workflow of reaction prediction, including reaction network generation, ab initio thermodynamics and microkinetic modelling. An overview of the frequently used regression models in machine learning is presented. As a promising alternative to full ab initio calculations, machine learning interatomic potentials are highlighted. Furthermore, we survey applications assisted by these methods for accelerating reaction prediction, exploring reaction networks, and computational catalyst design. Finally, we envisage future directions in computationally investigating reactions and implementing machine learning algorithms in heterogeneous catalysis.},

  abstract = {The study of chemical reactions in aqueous media is very important for its implications in several fields of science, from biology to industrial processes. However, modeling these reactions is difficult when water directly participates in the reaction, since it requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the system. Ab-initio molecular dynamics is the ideal candidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a high computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics simulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set of quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is difficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition state configurations. In this study we used an active learning procedure accelerated by enhanced sampling to harvest such structures and to build a neural-network potential to study the urea decomposition process in water. This allowed us to obtain the free energy profiles of this important reaction in a wide range of temperatures, to discover several novel metastable states, and improve the accuracy of the kinetic rates calculations. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the zwitterionic intermediate has the same probability of occurring via an acidic or a basic pathway, which could be the cause of the insensitivity of reaction rates to the solution pH.},

Despite both theoretical and practical importance, the role of water molecules in the reactivity and endo/exo selectivity remains unclear. To explore how water accelerates the reactions and improves the endo/exo selectivity of the cycloadditions of 1,3-dipole phthalazinium-2-dicyanomethanide (1) and two dipolarophiles, an ab initio-quality neural network potential that overcomes the computational bottleneck of explicitly considering water molecules was used. It is demonstrated that not only the nature of both the dipolarophile and the 1,3-dipole, but also the solvent medium, can perturb or even alter the reaction mechanism. An extreme case was found for the reaction of 1,3-dipole 1 with methyl vinyl ketone, in which the reaction mechanism changes from a concerted to a stepwise mode on going from MeCN to H2O as solvent, with formation of a zwitterionic intermediate that is a very shallow minimum on the energy surface. Thus, high stereocontrol can still be expected despite the stepwise nature of the mechanism. The results indicate that water can induce global polarization along the reaction coordinate and highlight the role of microsolvation effects and bulk-phase effects in reproducing the experimentally observed aqueous acceleration and enhanced endo/exo selectivity.},

  abstract = {In large-scale computations of physical problems, one often encounters the situation of having to determine a multidimensional function, which can be numerically costly when computing each point in this multidimensional space is already time-demanding. In the work, we propose that the active learning algorithm can speed up such calculations. The basic idea is to fit a multidimensional function by neural networks, and the key point is to make the query of labeled data more economical by using a strategy called "query by committee." We present the general protocol of this fitting scheme, as well as the procedure of how to further compute physical observables with the fitted functions. We show that this method can work well with two examples, which are the quantum three-body problem in atomic physics and the anomalous Hall conductivity in condensed matter physics, respectively. In these examples, we show that one reaches an accuracy of a few percent error in computing physical observables, all the while using fewer than 10\% of total data points compared with uniform sampling. With these two examples, we also visualize that by using the active learning algorithm, the required amount of data points are added mostly in the regime where the function varies most rapidly, which explains the mechanism for the efficiency of the algorithm. We expect broad applications of our method to various kinds of computational physical problems. Neural network (NN) based supervised learning methods have nowadays found broad applications in studying quantum physics in condensed matter materials and atomic, molecular and optical systems [1,2]. On the theoretical side, applications include finding orders and topological invariants in quantum phases [3-9], generating variational wave functions for quantum many-body states [10-14] and speeding up quantum Monte Carlo sampling [15,16]. On the experimental side, these methods can help optimizing experimental protocols [17,18] and analyzing experimental data [19-21]. Usually the supervised learning scheme requires a huge set of labeled data. However, in many physical applications, labeling data can be quite expensive in terms of computational resources. For instance, performing computation or experiments repeatedly can be time-and resources-demanding. Therefore, in many cases, labeled data are not abundant, which is a challenge that has prevented many applications. The active learning is a scheme to solve this problem [22]. It starts from training a NN with a small initial data set, and then actively queries the labeled data based on the prediction of the NN and iteratively improves the performance of the NN until the goal of the task is reached. With this approach, sampling the large parameter space can be made more efficiently, and the demand of labeled data is usually much less than normal supervised learning methods. Recently a few works have applied the active learning algorithm to determination of the interatomic potentials in quantum materials [23-25] and to optimal control in quantum experiments [26,27]. In these situations, labeled data have to be obtained either by ab initio calculation or by repeating experiments, which are both time consuming. In this work, we focus on a class of general and common task in computational physics that is to numerically determine a multidimensional function, say, F (α 1 , α 2 ,. .. , α n), where α i are parameters. Supposing that we uniformly discretize each parameter into L points, there are then L n data points in total that need to be calculated. In many cases, calculation of each point already takes quite some time, and thus the total computational cost can be massive. Nevertheless, for most functions, there are regions where the function varies smoothly and regions where the function varies rapidly. Ideally, the goal is to sample more points in the steep regions and fewer points in the smooth regions in order to efficiently obtain a good fitting in the entire parameter space. However, it seems to be a paradox because one does not know which regions the function varies more rapidly prior to computing the function. Here we show that this goal can be achieved by using the active learning algorithm and the "query by committee" strategy [28] where data points are added iteratively. Below we will first introduce the general protocol and then demonstrate the algorithm in two concrete problems: the quantum three-body problem and the anomalous Hall conductivity problem.},

We first show that the transferable atomic energy can be defined within the density functional theory, which means that the core of machine-learning potentials is to deduce a reference atomic-energy function from the given set of total energies. By utilizing invariant points in the feature space at which the atomic energy has a fixed reference value, we examine the atomic energy mapping of neural network potentials. Examples on Si consistently support that NNPs are capable of learning correct atomic energies. However, we also find that the neural network potential is vulnerable to 'ad hoc' mapping in which the total energy appears to be trained accurately while the atomic energy mapping is incorrect in spite of its capability. We show that the energy mapping can be improved by choosing the training set carefully and monitoring the atomic energy at the invariant points during the training procedure. The energy mapping in multicomponent systems is also discussed.},

The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of 6 non-enzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes. Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test its ability to reproduce free energy profiles generated from a target QM model. We perform these * To whom correspondence should be addressed 1 comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2 semiempirical models because they produce free energy profiles which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free energy profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6 Å. We further find that the model's initial training benefits from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce 4 different reactions and yielded good agreement with the free energy profiles made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free energy surfaces and 1D free energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs, but was sped up almost 100-fold when using an NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free energy applications ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design. 2},

  abstract = {Understanding and prediction of the chemical reactions are fundamental demanding in the study of many complex chemical systems. Reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been widely used for this purpose as it can offer atomic details and can help us better interpret chemical reaction mechanisms. In this study, two reference datasets were constructed and corresponding neural network (NN) potentials were trained based on them. For given large-scale reaction systems, the NN potentials can predict the potential energy and atomic forces of DFT precision, while it is orders of magnitude faster than the conventional DFT calculation. With these two models, reactive MD simulations were performed to explore the combustion mechanisms of hydrogen and methane. Benefit from the high efficiency of the NN model, nanosecond MD trajectories for large-scale systems containing hundreds of atoms were produced and detailed combustion mechanism was obtained. Through further development, the algorithms in this study can be used to explore and discovery reaction mechanisms of many complex reaction systems, such as combustion, synthesis, and heterogeneous catalysis without any predefined reaction coordinates and elementary reaction steps.},

  abstract = {The efficient selection of representative configurations that are used in high-level electronic structure calculations needed for the development of many-body molecular models poses a challenge to current data-driven approaches to molecular simulations. Here, we introduce an active learning (AL) framework for generating training sets corresponding to individual many-body contributions to the energy of an N-body system, which are required for the development of MB-nrg potential energy functions (PEFs). Our AL framework is based on uncertainty and error estimation and uses Gaussian process regression to identify the most relevant configurations that are needed for an accurate representation of the energy landscape of the molecular system under examination. Taking the Cs+-water system as a case study, we demonstrate that the application of our AL framework results in significantly smaller training sets than previously used in the development of the original MB-nrg PEF, without loss of accuracy. Considering the computational cost associated with high-level electronic structure calculations, our AL framework is particularly well-suited to the development of many-body PEFs, with chemical and spectroscopic accuracy, for molecular-level computer simulations from the gas to the condensed phase.},

  abstract = {Micro-bubbles and bubbly flows are widely observed and applied in chemical engineering, medicine, involves deformation, rupture, and collision of bubbles, phase mixture, etc. We study bubble dynamics by setting up two numerical simulation cases: bubbly flow with a single bubble and multiple bubbles, both confined in the microchannel, with parameters corresponding to their medical backgrounds. Both the cases have their medical background applications. Multiphase flow simulation requires high computation accuracy due to possible component losses that may be caused by sparse meshing during the computation. Hence, data-driven methods can be adopted as an useful tool. Based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we propose a novel deep learning framework BubbleNet, which entails three main parts: deep neural networks (DNN) with sub nets for predicting different physics fields; the semi-physics-informed part, with only the fluid continuum condition and the pressure Poisson equation P encoded within; the time discretized normalizer (TDN), an algorithm to normalize field data per time step before training. We apply the traditional DNN and our BubbleNet to train the coarsened simulation data and predict the physics fields of both the two bubbly flow cases. The BubbleNets are trained for both with and without P, from which we conclude that the ’physics-informed’ part can serve as an inner supervision. Results indicate our framework can predict the physics fields more accurately, estimating the prediction absolute errors. Our deep learning predictions outperforms traditional numerical methods computed with similar data density meshing. The proposed network can potentially be applied to many other engineering fields.},

  abstract = {Recently, machine learning methods have become easy-to-use tools for constructing high-dimensional interatomic potentials with ab initio accuracy. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials are generally orders of magnitude faster than first-principles calculations, they remain much slower than classical force fields, at the price of using more complex structural descriptors. To bridge this efficiency gap, we propose an embedded atom neural network approach with simple piecewise switching function-based descriptors, resulting in a favorable linear scaling with the number of neighbor atoms. Numerical examples validate that this piecewise machine-learning model can be over an order of magnitude faster than various popular machine-learned potentials with comparable accuracy for both metallic and covalent materials, approaching the speed of the fastest embedded atom method (i.e. several ms per atom per CPU core). The extreme efficiency of this approach promises its potential in first-principles atomistic simulations of very large systems and/or in a long timescale.},

We uncover an intriguing correlation-induced freezing behavior as doped holes are segregated from half-filled insulating background during equilibration. While the aggregation of holes is stabilized by the formation of ferromagnetic clusters through Hund's coupling between charge carriers and local magnetic moments, this stabilization also creates confining potentials for holes when antiferromagnetic spin-spin correlation is well developed in the background. The dramatically reduced mobility of the self-trapped holes prematurely disrupts further growth of the ferromagnetic clusters, leading to an arrested phase separation. Implications of our findings for phase separation dynamics in materials that exhibit colossal magnetoresistance effect are discussed.},

Yet, the number and/or the propagation time of trajectories are often limited by high computational costs, and numerous energies and forces generated on-the-fly become wasted after simulations. We demonstrate here an example of reusing only a very small portion of existing direct dynamics data to reconstruct a 90-dimensional globally accurate reactive PES describing the interaction of CO2 with a movable Ni(100) surface based on a machine learning approach. In addition to reproducing previous results with much better statistics, we predict scattering probabilities of CO2 at the state-tostate level, which is extremely demanding for direct dynamics. We propose this unified way to investigate gaseous and gas-surface reactions of medium size, initiating with hundreds of preliminary direct dynamics trajectories, followed by low-cost and high-quality simulations on full-dimensional analytical PESs.},

This strategy keeps structural descriptors symmetry invariant so that the resulting tensorial NN models are as efficient as their scalar counterparts. We validate the performance and universality of this approach by learning response properties of water oligomers and liquid water, and transition dipole moment of a model structural unit of proteins. Machine learned tensorial models have enabled efficient simulations of vibrational spectra of liquid water and ultraviolet spectra of realistic proteins, promising feasible and accurate spectroscopic simulations for biomolecules and materials.},

We demonstrate that the EANN approach is equally accurate as several established ML models in representing both big molecular and extended periodic systems, yet with much fewer parameters and configurations. It is highly efficient as it implicitly contains the three-body information without an explicit sum of the conventional costly angular descriptors.

Experimentally, the structure of clusters is difficult to determine, but it is very important in understanding their chemistry and properties. Computational methods can be used to examine cluster structure, however finding the most stable structure is not simple, particularly as the cluster size increases. Global optimization techniques have long been used to tackle the problem of the most stable structure, but such approaches would have to look for a global minimum, while sampling local minima over the whole potential energy surface as well. In this review, the state-of-the-art theory of global optimization theory is summarized. First, the definition, significance, relation to experiments, and a brief history of global optimization is presented. We then discuss, in more detail, three versatile global optimization methods: the basin hopping, the artificial bee colony algorithm, and the genetic algorithm.

However, unlike the mature deployment of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, its development in molecular modeling and simulations is still at an early stage, largely because the inductive biases of molecules are completely different from those of images or texts. Footed on these differences, we first reviewed the limitations of traditional deep learning models from the perspective of molecular physics and wrapped up some relevant technical advancement at the interface between molecular modeling and deep learning. We do not focus merely on the ever more complex neural network models; instead, we introduce various useful concepts and ideas brought by modern deep learning. We hope that transacting these ideas into molecular modeling will create new opportunities. For this purpose, we summarized several representative applications, ranging from supervised to unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and discussed their connections with the emerging trends in deep learning. Finally, we give an outlook for promising directions which may help address the existing issues in the current framework of deep molecular modeling.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations are widely applied in the study of chemical and bio-physical systems of interest. However, the accessible timescales of atomistic simulations are limited, and extracting equilibrium properties of systems containing rare events remains challenging. Two distinct strategies are usually adopted in this regard: either sticking to the atomistic level and performing enhanced sampling, or trading details for speed by leveraging coarse-grained models. Although both strategies are promising, either of them, if adopted individually, exhibits severe limitations. In this paper we propose a machine-learning approach to take advantage of both strategies. In this approach, simulations on different scales are executed simultaneously and benefit mutually from their cross-talks: Accurate coarse-grained (CG) models can be inferred from the fine-grained (FG) simulations; In turn, FG simulations can be boosted by the guidance of CG models. Our method grounds on unsupervised and reinforcement learning, defined by a variational and adaptive training objective, and allows end-to-end training of parametric models. Through multiple experiments, we show that our method is efficient and flexible, and performs well on challenging chemical and bio-molecular systems.},

  abstract = {How initialization and loss function affect the learning of a deep neural network (DNN), specifically its generalization error, is an important problem in practice. In this work, by exploiting the linearity of DNN training dynamics in the NTK regime (Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019), we provide an explicit and quantitative answer to this problem. Focusing on regression problem, we prove that, in the NTK regime, for any loss in a general class of functions, the DNN finds the same global minima—the one that is nearest to the initial value in the parameter space, or equivalently, the one that is closest to the initial DNN output in the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Using these optimization problems, we quantify the impact of initial output and prove that a random non-zero one increases the generalization error. We further propose an antisymmetrical initialization (ASI) trick that eliminates this type of error and accelerates the training. To understand whether the above results hold in general, we also perform experiments for DNNs in the non-NTK regime, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results and the ASI trick in a qualitative sense. Overall, our work serves as a baseline for the further investigation of the impact of initialization and loss function on the generalization of DNNs, which can potentially guide and improve the training of DNNs in practice.},

Unfortunately, the harsh measurement environment of spent fuel makes it difficult to obtain. With the continuous updating of computing technology, people have developed the method for calculating the redox potentials using first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD), but limited by the calculation cost, the simulation scale and time of FPMD are restricted. To make the calculation results more convincing, this work used deep potential (DP) to realize redox potential calculation on a larger time scale. We extracted datasets from FPMD calculations and used these to train and validate the DP, and compared energies, forces, and radial distribution functions that are evaluated using DFT and DP, to demonstrate that DP can achieve DFT accuracy. Using La3+/La as the reference electrode, the redox potentials of Ce3+/Ce, Pr3+/Pr, and Y3+/Y in the LiCl-KCl mixed molten salt system at 723 K were calculated. The results matched well with the FPMD results and experimental data. This work fully demonstrates the feasibility of the DP in calculating the redox potentials. Simultaneously, it provides new idea for obtaining accurate data in the process of spent fuel reprocessing.},

We prepare two samples with low and high concentrations of D atoms. We observe evaporation of D molecules out of the Li-Sn slabs in both concentrations of D. With detailed analysis, we unveil a cooperative process of forming D-2 molecules in liquid Li-Sn, where Li atoms act as catalytic centers to trap a D atom before another D comes nearby to form a molecule, and the surplus charges are transferred from D-2 to nearby Sn atoms. Furthermore, we predict a temperature window in the low concentration case in which D-2 molecules can escape to vacuum, while LiD molecules cannot. The above findings deepen our understanding of interactions between hydrogen isotopes and Li-Sn liquid metal. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {An ion embedded in warm/hot dense plasmas will greatly alter its microscopic structure and dynamics, as well as the macroscopic radiation transport properties of the plasmas, due to complicated many-body interactions with surrounding particles. Accurate theoretically modeling of such kind of quantum many-body interactions is essential but very challenging. In this work, we propose an atomic-state-dependent screening model for treating the plasmas with a wide range of temperatures and densities, in which the contributions of three-body recombination processes are included. We show that the electron distributions around an ion are strongly correlated with the ionic state studied due to the contributions of three-body recombination processes. The feasibility and validation of the proposed model are demonstrated by reproducing the experimental result of the line-shift of hot-dense plasmas as well as the classical molecular dynamic simulations of moderately coupled ultra-cold neutral plasmas. Our work opens a promising way to treat the screening effect of hot and warm dense plasma, which is a bottleneck of those extensive studies in high-energy-density physics, such as atomic processes in plasma, plasma spectra and radiation transport properties, among others. Atoms embedded in dense hot plasmas are affected by complex many-body interactions which challenges our capacity to model high energy density plasma. The authors propose a solution to the effects of many-body interactions on ions in dense plasmas, with a particular focus on the threebody interaction.},

  abstract = {Constitutive models are widely used for modeling complex systems in science and engineering, where first principle-based, well-resolved simulations are often prohibitively expensive. For example, in  uid dynamics, constitutive models are required to describe nonlocal, unresolved physics such as turbulence and laminar turbulent transition. However, traditional constitutive models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) often lack robustness and are too rigid to accommodate diverse calibration datasets. We propose a  frame independent, nonlocal constitutive model based on a vector-cloud neural network that can be learned with data. The model predicts the closure variable at a point based on the  ow information in its neighborhood. Such nonlocal information is represented by a group of points, each having a feature vector attached to it, and thus the input is referred to as vector cloud. The cloud is mapped to the closure variable through a frame-independent neural network, invariant both to coordinate translation and rotation and to the ordering of points in the cloud. As such, the network can deal with any number of arbitrarily arranged grid points and thus is suitable for unstructured meshes in uid simulations. The merits of the proposed network are demonstrated for scalar transport PDEs on a family of parameterized periodic hill geometries. The vectorcloud neural network is a promising tool not only as nonlocal constitutive models and but also as general surrogate models for PDEs on irregular domains.},

  abstract = {Recent discoveries of dynamic ice VII and superionic ice highlight the importance of ionic diffusions in discriminating high-pressure (P) water phases. The rare event nature and the chemical bond breaking associated with these diffusions, however, make extensive simulations of these processes unpractical to ab initio and inappropriate for force field based methods. Using a first-principles neural network potential, we performed a theoretical study of water at 5-70 GPa and 300-3000 K. Long-time dynamics of protons and oxygens were found indispensable in discriminating several subtle states of water, characterized by proton's and oxygen ion's diffusion coefficients and the distribution of proton's displacements. Within dynamic ice VII, two types of proton transfer mechanisms, i.e., translational and rotational transfers, were identified to discriminate this region further into dynamic ice VII T and dynamic ice VII R. The triple point between ice VII, superionic ice (SI), and liquid exists because the loosening of the bcc oxygen skeleton is prevented by the decrease of interatomic distances at high P's. The melting of ice VII above similar to 40 GPa can be understood as a process of two individual steps: the melting of protons and the retarded melting of oxygens, responsible for the forming of SI. The boundary of the dynamic ice VII and SI lies on the continuation line ice VII's melting curve at low P's. Based on these, a detailed phase diagram is given, which may shed light on studies of water under P's in a wide range of interdisciplinary sciences.},

In this Account, we focus on the out-of-the-box approaches to developing transferable MLIPs for diverse chemical tasks. First, we introduce the "Accurate Neural Network engine for Molecular Energies,"ANAKIN-ME, method (or ANI for short). The ANI model utilizes Justin Smith Symmetry Functions (JSSFs) and realizes training for vast data sets. The training data set of several orders of magnitude larger than before has become the key factor of the knowledge transferability and flexibility of MLIPs. As the quantity, quality, and types of interactions included in the training data set will dictate the accuracy of MLIPs, the task of proper data selection and model training could be assisted with advanced methods like active learning (AL), transfer learning (TL), and multitask learning (MTL).Next, we describe the AIMNet "Atoms-in-Molecules Network"that was inspired by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The AIMNet architecture lifts multiple limitations in MLIPs. It encodes long-range interactions and learnable representations of chemical elements. We also discuss the AIMNet-ME model that expands the applicability domain of AIMNet from neutral molecules toward open-shell systems. The AIMNet-ME encompasses a dependence of the potential on molecular charge and spin. It brings ML and physical models one step closer, ensuring the correct molecular energy behavior over the total molecular charge.We finally describe perhaps the simplest possible physics-aware model, which combines ML and the extended Hückel method. In ML-EHM, "Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network,"HIP-NN generates the set of a molecule- and environment-dependent Hamiltonian elements α𝜇𝜇 and K‡. As a test example, we show how in contrast to traditional Hückel theory, ML-EHM correctly describes orbital crossing with bond rotations. Hence it learns the underlying physics, highlighting that the inclusion of proper physical constraints and symmetries could significantly improve ML model generalization.}

Part of its simplicity arises from using only two types of empirically fit physics-motivated parameters: the first describes the orbital energies on each atom and the second describes electronic interactions and bonding between atoms. By replacing these traditionally static parameters with dynamically predicted values, we vastly increase the accuracy of the extended Hückel model. The dynamic values are generated with a deep neural network, which is trained to reproduce orbital energies and densities derived from density functional theory. The resulting model retains interpretability while the deep neural network parameterization is smooth, accurate, and reproduces insightful features of the original static parameterization. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hückel model, and not the deep neural network, is responsible for capturing intricate orbital interactions in two molecular case studies.
